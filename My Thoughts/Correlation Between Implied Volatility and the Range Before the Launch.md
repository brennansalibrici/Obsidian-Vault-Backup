## Context
%% Why am I making a note on this? What happened? %%
Currently the S&P (and US Stocks) are very volatile but theyâ€™re starting to look like this pullback is turning around. The sellers have a good opportunity to sell the last couple days and they did not. I want to put on some calendar spreads but I know the volatility will hurt me if I do it now. The volatility needs to suck out of the market first which made me wonder if thereâ€™s some kind of correlation between implied volatility and that range because I know that the BigBoys employ options extensively. I have to explore this later
## Feelings
%% What are some feelings I've had? %%
Iâ€™m a bit anxious to buy this pullback. I know I need to wait until the BigBoy proves heâ€™s ready to go so I need to stay calm and wait for now. 
## Thoughts
%% What am I thinking? %%
There has to be some sort of correlation between these two things and I need to find out what it is. 
## Future Plan
%% Are there any actions to take? Did I learn anything?%%
DOD style research can prove this hypothesis
