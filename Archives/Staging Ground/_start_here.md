I hope this vault can be the push you need to adopt the second brain lifestyle, to have a system supporting the pursuit towards your ideal life by leveraging modern technologies and practices for personal knowledge management, productivity, and life design.

I've tried to only keep things that are fundamental to the three key pillars of the vault, but different people come from different backgrounds with different questions and use cases, so I can't put in anything too specific like content workflows.

Fortunately, after some time learning, exploring, and using the vault, you will be able to customize it to your needs.

Lastly, my product's value should at least be worth the effort that went into your purchase price. If it doesn't satisfy your needs, I have a 100% refund guarantee. All I ask is your reason for doing so.

## Get Started
Now, there's a lot to take in at first and I know you're eager to start using the vault, but to ensure you have the resources and support you need I need to introduce you to the other parts:
### Reaching out for help
You can always email me ransomguest@gmail.com but I recommend you join below for more frequent updates and communication:

### Verifying vault functionality
To ensure the vault was properly loaded, here's a quick checklist:
- [ ] Verify the different levels of headers in this note are different colors: #hidden 
	- # this should be red
	- ## this should be orange
	- ### this should be green-ish
- [ ] Verify the panes on the left and right sidebars do not say anything like "Plugin x not found" #hidden 

If any of the above do not happen, go to settings and make sure they're all enabled, then go quit and re-open the app ðŸ¤ž

If that still doesn't work, you can contact me in one of the ways in [[#Reaching out for help]]
