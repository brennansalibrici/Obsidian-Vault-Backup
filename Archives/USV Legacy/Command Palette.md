### Command palette
Search and run any existing command or hotkey from anywhere.

```button
name Open command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+o)
type command
action Command palette: Open command palette
```

After hotkeys, I feel this is the most efficient way to navigate and use your vault:
- Instead of having to move your mouse to click a button, you can just open this then type the command you want to run ðŸ¤©
- Almost anything can be turned into a command (note creation, opening a pane

So, to slowly encourage point out which commands are most important to using the vault (which you probably have already seen), I will be including buttons in these notes when relevant like the one above to let you know that there's almost always a command for something ðŸ¤©
### Other palettes
- For opening and creating notes, the [[Creating and modifying notes|Quick Switcher]]
- To create different [[Note types]] in the vault you can use [[QuickAdd Plugin#Palette]]
