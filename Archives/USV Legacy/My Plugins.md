I try to explain what plugins I use and for what purpose in each workflow, but if you want to modify them then I'd recommend reading their respective documentations or external tutorials.

If you want to explore any plugins further, **Each plugin has a documentation page, go to Settings > Community Plugins > Click on the plugin title**

## Required
![[Obsidian Community Plugins#Dedicated Notes]]
## Appearance
If you're a fan of customizing your own theme, then the Minimal Theme is all you need. Instead of having to modify code to change it, the [[#Minimal Theme Settings]] should allow you most of the customization you want.

### Minimal Theme Settings
Helps with [[Managing appearance and theme]]

Includes preset color schemes and toggles for different visual settings

If you want to change header colors, you will have to disable setting for colorful headings by running the command:
```button
name Minimal Theme Settings: Toggle colorful headings
type command
action Minimal Theme Settings: Toggle colorful headings
```
### Style Settings
- Ultimate customization
- Change CSS design and colors of background, headers, text, etc
- Also helps with [[Supercharged Links Plugin]]
## Quality of Life
### [[Auto Note Mover Plugin]]
- Can move notes based on tags or title using regex
### Completed Task Display
- Can hide/show completed tasks on the sidebar or with the command
### Copy Block Link
I use this most when turning literature notes into 

```button
name Copy Block Link: Copy embed to current block or heading
type command
action Copy Block Link: Copy embed to current block or heading
```
### Commander
- Can add commands to different parts of the Obsidian layout for quick access
- ex) If you're using Obsidian Publish, you can add a command at the top right of the note to open the publish URL
### [[Daily Note Outline Plugin]]
- Pane to acces contents of daily notes
### Emoji Toolbar
- (You will still have to download it) Quick access to emojis using `Ctrl+Shift+E` to spice up your notes ;)
- I have gotten used to just using the native mac/windows emoji selectors, and instead use `emoji shortcodes` plugin to type them out
### File Tree Alternative
- View contents of notes, "zoom in" on select folders, fold/collapse all
### Hide Sidebars When Narrow
- Useful for when you shrink Obsidian to a fraction of your screen
### Highlightr
- Different colored highlights for your notes
### Linter
- Formats the content of our notes to keep notes structure consistent
- Right now is triggered upon save and when switching to a different note
### Outliner
Modifies bullet list behavior in Obsidian.

Gives more hotkeys for handling lists like:
- Fold list
- Unfold list
- Move lists and sublists up
- Move lists and sublists down

### Obsidian42 - BRAT
- Can use non-published community plugins without them being released
### Natural Language Dates
- Can type words like @@today which will turn into the date equivalent
### Paste URL into selection
- Normally when you select text and paste something, it will replace the selected with the pasted
- However, this plugin creates a hyperlink instead with the selected text as the alias
### Recent Files
- Self-explanatory
### Smart Random Note
- Has a command to open a random note based on current search query (see dice icons on left toolbar)
