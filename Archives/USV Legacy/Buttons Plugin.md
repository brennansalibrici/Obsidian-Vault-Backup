Description: Insert commands in your notes
---
- Sometimes buttons are also made with [[Obsidian Meta Bind Plugin]]
- When you click one of the create buttons with something in your clipboard, it uses it as the title
	- example use case: after creating a project, copy header title then click on create kanban
- If the name of the command changes, be sure to modify any related buttons to ensure they continue working
## Warnings
- If you look into the code block, it knows what command to run based on the title. So if you change the name of a command like a [[QuickAdd Plugin#Template Choice]], then you will end up having to update the button as well.
## Uses
- This is what I have been using throughout the lessons in the vault
- Lets you quickly create a new note when in a [[View notes]] for a note type
