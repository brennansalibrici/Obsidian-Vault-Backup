Description: Easily access the links of a note beside the link itself
---

## Principles

- Adds badges to links to show how many times it is linked
  - Hovering over it will show all backlinks
  - Clicking on it will open it in a new pane
  - Unlike the traditional backlinks pane which shows backlinks based on the note you are on, this pane will stay until you click onto another Strange New Worlds badge
- Includes the context of the link (children tags, the header it is in, etc)
- If a note in your header has a link to it, it will show beside the header ðŸ¤¯
  - Check the header above and beside the link itself after linking it [[Obsidian Strange New Worlds Plugin#Principles]]

## Uses

- With the ability to link to headers, you can use it to collect sections of a note
- For example, when I take notes on a conversation in [[Daily Template#Conversations]], at the top of the conversation I can make a link to [[Person Template#Conversations]] so if I visit that header and hover over the badge I can see all the conversations I had with that person.
