A way to access notes and create new ones.

If I know the title of the note, this is my main method of opening it.

To open, hit `Ctrl/Cmd+o`

```button
name Quick switcher: Open quick switcher
type command
action Quick switcher: Open quick switcher
```

Once you find the note in the results, there are ways you can open it:
- On current tab, `Enter`
- On new tab, `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`
- On new view and tab, `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt/Opt+Enter`

If you need to quickly rename the title, you can run the command:

```button
name Rename file
type command
action Rename file
```

## Note types
This will be covered more in-depth later on but using the [[QuickAdd Plugin]] you can create any special [[Note types]] in the vault.

For example, if you wanted to create a [[Brainstorms]] note in the vault, you would just do:

```button
name QuickAdd: ðŸ’¡ Create Brainstorm Note
type command
action QuickAdd: ðŸ’¡ Create Brainstorm Note
```
