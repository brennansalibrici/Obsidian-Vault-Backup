## Context
---
I was having a lot of trouble being at Celebration Church with Pastor Lowell Lundstrom. I didn't feel like I was being fed spiritually and didn't like how simple or child-like his messages were. I think I wanted to be taught something and probably at a higher academic level than what was being offered there. It's also important to note that Pastor Lowell's target audience had always been the unsaved and spoke to people at a normal blue collar, real life guy's level. He never pretended to be a great Bible scholar and I think I was trying to put him in that mold and probably had too much pride and thought of myself as smarter than he was or something like that. 

## Received
---
'Brennan, I can use whoever I want to, whenever I want to and I can use them ***in spite of*** who they are and what they have done'

## Life Application
---
I may or may not like who (and in what position) He has put in my life, and that is His choice, not mine and I can fight Him and have a bad attitude about it or I can trust Him, accept His sovereignty, go with it and God can still speak to me and bless me even through a broken and imperfect vessel. (As if I'm not also a broken and imperfect vessel too!)
