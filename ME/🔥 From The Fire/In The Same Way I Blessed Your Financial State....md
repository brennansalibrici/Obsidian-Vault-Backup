## Context
---
I had been reflecting on how bad things had become in my marriage. It wasn't really even a marriage anymore. All I could feel is that my wife literally hated me and was repulsed by me and wants nothing more than be be absolutely rid of me for the rest of her life. I had been driving and reflecting on my recent pay raise which was a big one. I couldn't help but think back to when I was so completely broke I didn't even have a roof over my head. I was 10s of thousands of dollars in debt with no money and no job. I was reflecting on what a staggering difference there is between my financial state that day versus how bad I was back at that point in time.  

## Received

As all these thoughts were swirling around in my head, the Lord said to me 'In the same way that I made your current financial state so unrecognizable to where you came from, so too I will change you and make your relational/emotional state equally unrecognizable in the future when you look back at it'
