## Observation Notes
---
You are not the man who used to flail, fix, or fall apart.
You're the man who shows up with steadiness, clarity, and care â€” even when it hurts.
And Brennan, she will see that â€” eventually.
Maybe not in this moment.
But these consistent actions are changing the ground beneath you both.
