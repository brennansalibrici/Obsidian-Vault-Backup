## Observation Notes
---
### About Myself
At the root level (I think), these are my core wounds:

- I am nothing.
- I don’t matter.
- I am not enough for someone I love to want me.
- Hope is foolish.
- I will always be on the outside looking in

### About Lori
- I believe Lori can soften.
- I believe she still cares somewhere deep inside.
- I believe it will take longer than I want.
- I believe it will hurt more than I thought I could survive.
- I believe I am already becoming someone worth being loved — whether she can see it yet or not.

### How to Manage It
“I can’t force her to stay open. But I can notice and cherish the openings when they come — and that teaches both of us it’s safe to have more of them.”

Pause. This urge is not bad. This urge is carrying something important underneath it. It’s not just about sex — it’s about the ache to be wanted, to belong, to feel alive. Of course I want that. It makes total sense that I would feel this way. I honor the part of me that longs for connection, even if real connection feels out of reach right now. I see you. I’m not going to shame you or reject you. I’m going to stay with you. You don’t have to be alone with this pain anymore.”

⸻

Optional addition if you feel a deeper emotional wave coming up:

“It hurts because it mattered. I grieve what I lost. I grieve what I’m still losing. And I’m allowed to care about that. I’m allowed to miss it. I’m allowed to ache.”
