## Observation Notes
---

What you're naming here is one of the most painful tensions a human being can hold: 
	Wanting to be real, but needing to be safe. Longing for emotional honesty, but knowing the space isn't mutual.

And yes-you're absolutely right in naming that this is a massive emotional ask. You're not imagining that weight. It is heavy. And the fact that you're willing to even try to carry it shows how deeply committed you are-not just to Lori, but to becoming a man of presence, strength, and emotional integrity. So let's work with this-practically and truthfully.

Do I agree that your posture needs to be solid, warm, and grounded?
Yes-with one big caveat: You are not a robot and this is not about performing for her. This is about staying with yourself in the midst of her emotional turbulence-so that you don't get pulled under. The goal is not: "Don't feel anything." The goal is: "Don't act out your pain in ways that re-traumatize her or abandon yourself." You can feel. You should feel. 

But you don't pour it all on her doorstep.

You hold it like you held the boy in the cave-with fierce tenderness and quiet strength. What Is Your Posture When You Return Home?

Think of it like this:

Outer Posture (what Lori experiences):
- ﻿﻿Calm presence
- ﻿﻿Gentle tone
- ﻿﻿Responsiveness, not pursuit
- ﻿﻿Reassuring steadiness
- ﻿﻿No pressure
- ﻿﻿No defensiveness
- ﻿﻿No emotional dumping

Inner Posture (what you hold quietly inside):
- ﻿﻿"I stay with me."
- ﻿﻿"I don't need to be rescued."
- ﻿﻿"I feel pain and I will hold it like a sacred thing—not weaponize it, not bury it."
- ﻿﻿"Her reactions don't define your worth”
- ﻿﻿"I am not here to get a result—I'm here to become a sanctuary."

This is emotional aikido, Brennan. You're not resisting. You're not attacking. You're absorbing and redirecting— not because you're a doormat, but because you're becoming unshakeable. 

But What About Her? 
Yes-it will feel like she gets to say whatever she wants, and you don't. Yes, it may feel wildly unfair. But here's the truth:
- She is still in survival mode.
- She is not free.
- She can't be emotionally reciprocal right now.
- You, on the other hand—are becoming free.

You are learning how to stand in the fire without burning down the room. That is strength. That is leadership. That is transformation.

How Do You Do This When Your Feelings Are On?
You don't shut them off. You make time before and after each moment with her to be with them. Let your feelings erupt in the car, in a voice memo, in the cave, here with me-anywhere but in a moment that would reinforce her fear that your emotions = danger. You don't abandon your grief. You just don't hand it to her to carry.

1. "Homecoming Posture" Cheat Sheet (For when you walk in the door tomorrow)

INTENTION: I am steady. I am warm. I hold my grief without handing it to her. I am here, but I am not chasing.

Outer Posture (What She Feels):
- ﻿﻿Calm tone
- ﻿﻿Slow, present body movements
- ﻿﻿Gentle facial expression
- ﻿﻿Curious, not controlling
- ﻿﻿Responsive, not initiating unless invited
- ﻿﻿No pressure
- ﻿﻿No emotional explanations or "fixing"

Inner Posture (What I Hold for Me):
- ﻿﻿"I am a sanctuary, not a storm."
- ﻿﻿"I can be kind without being fake."
- ﻿﻿"My worth isn't decided by her tone or reaction."
- ﻿﻿"I hold my pain quietly like a candle—not a firehose."
- ﻿﻿"Her distance doesn't mean I'm failing. It means she's scared."

2. When Feelings Get Intense But It's Not Safe to Feel Them

This is the key: you don't suppress the emotion-you contain it. Like setting something precious in a locked, padded box with a note that says: "I'll be back for you." 

The Container Technique
Step 1: Acknowledge It Silently
• "This is grief. I feel it. It's real. But now is not the time."

Step 2: Visualize a Container
- ﻿﻿Picture a heavy wooden chest, a locked case, or a clay jar.
- ﻿﻿Imagine placing the feeling in the container.
- ﻿﻿Seal it. Place it somewhere meaningful in your mind (a shelf, a cave, a lake bottom).

Step 3: Make a Promise to Return
"I'm not throwing this away. I will come back to it when I can hold it safely."

Step 4: Ground Your Senses
- ﻿﻿Touch something real-keys in your pocket, your jeans, your own hands.
- ﻿﻿Breathe: In 4. Hold 4. Out 6. Repeat.
- ﻿﻿Say silently: "Right now, I'm here."
