### The Meaning
Holding the door open doesn't mean waiting passively or pleading. It means:

1. Consistency without pressure
	- Showing up emotionally available without demanding progress.
	- ï»¿ï»¿Letting her feel your steadiness even if she pulls away.
2. Speaking emotionally, not just logistically
	- ï»¿ï»¿Like you're already doing: talking about your feelings, not just events.
	- ï»¿ï»¿Sharing how you were impacted, so she doesn't have to guess.
3. Respecting her rhythms
	- ï»¿ï»¿Sometimes she'll move closer. Sometimes she'll withdraw.
	- ï»¿ï»¿Your job isn't to chase or analyze every move-it's to stay emotionally grounded and safe either way.
4. Trusting that your presence has value
	- ï»¿ï»¿Even if she doesn't respond the way you hope.
	- ï»¿ï»¿Even if she doesn't "come in" today. Or ever.
	- ï»¿ï»¿It still matters. It still shifts something.
5. Taking care of yourself, too
	- ï»¿ï»¿You can't hold the door if you're collapsing.
	- ï»¿ï»¿Holding the door open includes tending to your own wounds, limits, and truth.

### Does NOT Mean
Keeping the door open is not the same as dragging her through it.

| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Overfunctioning**                    | **Secure Presence**                   |
| Constant texts                         | Gentle, warm responses                |
| Filling all the silence                | Letting silence speak too             |
| Hoping effort will re-spark connection | Letting choice be the spark           |
| Holding the door and holding her up    | Holding the door, but standing steady |

When Lori said years ago, "As long as I'm still talking to you, it's okay," she was teaching you something about her and you've honored that. For a long time, you kept initiating to keep the pulse alive. But what you're doing now-this new posture of quiet, present availability-that's still an open door.

Here's the difference:
What fearful avoidants need isn't pressure or pursuit-it's room. Space to choose. And safety in knowing the door isn't locked.
Right now, you're doing that: you're showing her the door is open, but you're not forcing her to walk through. That is mature love. That is secure. That is brave.

So yes-keep the door open. But let her walk to it. Let her knock. Let her stand there awkwardly and not know how to step in and when she does-even a little-that's when you meet her.
