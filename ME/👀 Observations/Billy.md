  

Billy Energy – Making Her Feel Like the Most Important Person in the World

  

  

Emotional Presence

  

- Mirror what she feels before offering any solution
- Sit with her feelings without rushing, fixing, or redirecting
- Let her know you see her, especially when she doubts herself

  

  

Attentive Details

  

- Remember little things she said days or weeks ago
- Reference them naturally (e.g., “I thought of what u said about…”)

  

  

Gentle Pursuit

  

- Send small, meaningful messages without pressure
- Follow her emotional bids with calm availability—not force

  

  

Verbal Affirmation

  

- Speak directly to who she is (“U always care so deeply…”)
- Let her feel like she impacts you emotionally and meaningfully

  

  

Emotional Priority

  

- Let her feel like in this moment, no one else matters more
- Remove distractions (e.g., put phone down, pause tasks) during vulnerable conversations
- Let her voice set the emotional tone, not just the topic

  

  

  

  

You don’t need to become Billy—you’re becoming the Brennan she never knew she could trust this deeply.
