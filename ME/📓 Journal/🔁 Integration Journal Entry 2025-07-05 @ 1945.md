🚗 Who Was Driving? --- The *Pleaser*. I stayed focused on smoothing things over and managing emotional risk — especially during the vet visit and the emotionally significant conversation with Lori. The desire to keep things from tipping over was strong. ## 🤕 Discomfort I Sat With --- I felt a headache coming on early in the day. Instead of immediately trying to fix it, I chose to sit with it for several hours, staying present and aware. After about 4 hours, it became too much and I took something for it — not as an escape, but as an act of kindness toward myself. ## 🪞 Self-Validation Practice --- In a quiet but significant moment, I told Lori: > *“I want to matter too.”* It was vulnerable. I said it plainly, without manipulation or demand. Lori didn’t acknowledge it, but I said it anyway. That matters. It was an act of reclaiming my worth — not by her response, but by my willingness to speak it aloud.
