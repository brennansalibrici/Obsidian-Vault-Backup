## 🚗 Who Was Driving?
---
The Pleaser — showing up to smooth things over and prevent conflict, but not at the cost of emotional honesty. Today, the Pleaser was present, but not self-erasing.

## 🤕 Discomfort I Sat With
---
During a conversation with Lori about the vet visit, she shared that she felt dismissed by something I did — and her reaction hit me so hard I physically winced. I felt real, literal emotional and physical pain in that moment. But I *did not collapse*. I stayed with her, stayed present, and by the end of the conversation, she was regulated again. That’s a win.

## 🪞 Self-Validation Practice
---
Despite how emotionally difficult today was, I said something vulnerable earlier this week — “I want to matter too” — and have continued walking in alignment with that truth. I don’t need her to affirm it for it to be real. I also had a grounded, meaningful conversation with Lori about the kids, Rocket, and true love. These are *steps*.

## 💌 Additional Practice – Letter to the Boy in the Cave
---
I wrote a full letter to the boy in the cave. It came out raw, fierce, and deeply honoring. I acknowledged the genius of how he survived, the reality of what it cost him, and offered to walk beside him as he learns to re-emerge. I promised I would train with him, not leave him behind. This letter felt less like an exercise and more like a *sacred message* to my exiled self.
