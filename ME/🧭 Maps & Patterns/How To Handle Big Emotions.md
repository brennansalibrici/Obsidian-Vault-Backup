## 🧭 So what do you do with feelings like this?

Let’s walk through a simple, healthy sequence you can repeat anytime:

---

### **1. Name it with clarity—not shame.**

> “I’m feeling lonely. I’m grieving connection I wish I had. I feel sad and hollow. This matters.”

✅ You already did this. You _named it without apologizing for it._ That’s a massive win.

---

### **2. Feel it—but give it a container.**

You don’t need to _wallow_, but you _do_ need to give the feeling some room.

⏱ Try this:

- Set a 10–20 minute timer.
    
- Sit with the feeling—no distractions, no solving.
    
- Ask: _“Where is this in my body?”_
    
- Let it come up. Cry if you need to. Place your hand on your chest or stomach if it helps.

✅ You’re not letting it take over your day—you’re honoring it without repression.

---

### **3. Reflect—what does this pain want me to know?**

Often, pain isn’t just _feeling_—it’s _information_.  
You might ask:

- _What need is unspoken here?_
    
- _What am I longing for that hasn’t been named yet?_
    
- _What lie is sneaking in alongside the grief? (e.g., “I’ll never be loved,” “I’m always alone”)_

This turns the pain into _wisdom_, instead of just ache.

---

### **4. Re-anchor your identity.**

Once the emotional wave passes, speak truth to yourself.

Not toxic positivity—**anchoring**.  
Like:

> “Yes, I’m sad. Yes, I’m grieving. But I’m not abandoned. I’m not worthless. I’m a man in process, and this pain is not the end of my story.”

✅ This is when you can read your affirmations. Or journal one short line of what’s true.

---

### **5. Choose a small action.**

You don’t have to solve your marriage today. But you _can_:

- Text your kid just to say hi.
    
- Go outside and move your body.
    
- Write a prayer or one line of what you _do_ want to feel someday.

Grief gets smaller when _you move_, not just when it goes away.

## 🔁 Summary Flow:

**Feel → Contain → Listen → Re-anchor → Act**

It doesn’t have to be fancy. But this practice, done daily or weekly, _literally rewires how your nervous system handles pain._
