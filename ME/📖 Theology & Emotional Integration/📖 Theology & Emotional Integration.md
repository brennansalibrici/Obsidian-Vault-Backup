Query reference to Peter Scazzeroâ€™s book - Emotionally Healthy Spirituality and other 'Input' materials I'm working on. 

This section is specifically intended to be a place for:
- Faith/Emotion specific insights, ideas, thoughts, etc.
- Referencing scripture (or commentaries, other thoughts, or anything else) that connect to healing, identity, grief, and growth
- Creating links and other connections to things like 
	- Emotionally Rooted Scriptures
	- Faith & Attachment Dynamics
	- Jesus and Emotional Safety
	- etc
