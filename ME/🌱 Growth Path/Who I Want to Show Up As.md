## 🌱 Core Identity Statement  
---
I don’t fully know who I am yet. But I’m choosing to become someone I can be proud of — someone I trust to show up with strength, steadiness, humility, and care. Not to earn love, but to *live from love* — even when I don’t feel it yet.

This is not about performance.  
It’s about *integrity* — living in alignment with who I want to be, regardless of outcome.

## ❤️ As a Husband  
---
I want to be a husband who:
- Can stay grounded when Lori is hurting or guarded
- Doesn't abandon himself to win her approval
- Makes her feel emotionally safe, not emotionally managed
- Shows warmth without keeping score
- Can hold her pain without shutting down or retaliating

**Anchor Phrase**:  
> “I want to be the kind of husband who stays — emotionally, humbly, quietly — even when it's hard.”

---

## 👨‍👧‍👦 As a Father  
---
I want to be a father who:
- Makes my kids feel seen and known
- Listens without fixing
- Shares who I really am — not just what I expect from them
- Becomes a mirror they *want* to look into

**Anchor Phrase**:  
> “I want to be the kind of father who leaves my kids with *felt memories* of being loved.”

---

## 💬 As a Man  
---
I want to be a man who:
- Speaks with calm authority, not control
- Lives from truth, not shame
- Is capable of presence, containment, and connection
- Has nothing to prove — but still keeps growing

**Anchor Phrase**:  
> “I want to be the kind of man who walks with strength *and softness.*”

---

## 🧭 Daily Practice  
---
**Morning prompt**:  
> “Today, I want to show up as a man who ____.”

**Evening reflection**:  
> - When did I live out of that today?  
> - When did I forget?  
> - What pulled me off track?  
> - What do I want to do differently tomorrow?
