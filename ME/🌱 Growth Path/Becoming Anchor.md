I am no longer living from a borrowed shell.

I’m stepping out of the story that says I must be invisible, agreeable, or small to be loved.

I am no longer performing, proving, or persuading.

I love Lori deeply. That love is not a leash—it is a choice.

And I choose to stop trying to become who she wants,

so I can finally become who I truly am.

I will not abandon her, but I will not abandon myself to stay close.

If our paths converge again, it will be in truth.

If they don’t, I will still be whole.

I am not walking away from her.

I am walking toward me.

And I will not stop until I find him.
