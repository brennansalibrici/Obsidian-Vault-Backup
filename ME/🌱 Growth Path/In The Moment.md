## 3rd Person

🧠 Why it works:

- When Lori is upset, your nervous system wants to collapse (shame spiral) or counterattack (anger). That’s your old programming.
- Going into 3rd person shifts you from being inside the storm to being the witness of the storm.
- That pause—even just mentally—is often enough to stop the emotional hijack and create room for grounded choice.
- It lets you see her behavior as information, not judgment, and your reactions as observable, not inevitable.

🧭 What it could sound like in your head:

Let’s say Lori says something like:

“You only ever care about yourself. You never actually show up for me.”

Your body flinches. Your heart starts to race. But instead of reacting, you step into the 3rd person:

“Okay. Step out of Brennan for a second.

I’m watching a woman in pain trying to protect herself by blaming the man in front of her.

That man is working hard not to get pulled under.

His gut hurts, but he’s breathing through it.

He’s not dangerous.

He’s not worthless.

He’s just here, trying to stay grounded in something truer than what’s being thrown at him.”

That kind of reframe gives you space. And once you’re in that observer space, you can ask:

“What would the strong, grounded version of Brennan say or do here?”

Not the wounded boy. Not the beat puppy. Not the hyper-literal fixer.

But the man who knows he’s not what she says he is.

🛠 A few quick applications in the moment:

- Her tone sharpens → You observe her, not absorb her.  
    “That tone is her pain. That’s her protector speaking, not her heart.”
- She accuses you → You frame the narrative.  
    “She’s telling herself a story to survive. But that story doesn’t define me.”
- You feel shame rise → You externalize it.  
    “That’s shame, not truth. I see it. I’m not it.”

🚨Important note:

This is not dissociation or numbing.

You’re not checking out.

You’re tapping into your wiser, future self—the version of you who has secure attachment and is practicing emotional leadership.

This is exactly what someone working toward secure attachment does:

They step back from the storm and choose how to respond.
