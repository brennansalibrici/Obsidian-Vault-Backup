Unwilling to enage - Whenever feelings or stuff comes up for me, nobody cares. Nobody wants to hear about it, process it or is curious about any of it. I'm expected to act/perform a certain way period. I guess this is what happens when u don't have a partner. 

I don't belong - I rarely have felt that I belong in my own family or my own house in any way shape or form. I'm expected to work when everyone else is relaxing. I sleep on whatever couch is open. I don't even know where to store any of my stuff. I've ended up with a corner of the garage that I can put stuff without being told it's not ok to have it there. I know 1000 places where I can't have stuff. I know of 1 place that I can have it. Well see how long that lasts for. 

I truly do not believe that she cares to know anything about me at all. She is more interested in telling me how I feel, analyzing me, judging and criticizing me than caring to know, find out or being about a damn thing about me.
