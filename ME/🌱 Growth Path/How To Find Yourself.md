## 🔁 7-DAY STRUCTURE FOR UNCOVERING YOURSELF
We’re going to keep this very simple. Each day will include a few key practices. Here’s your starting map:

### DAILY PRACTICE (10–20 minutes)
1. Read Your Anchor Aloud  
    - Say the Becoming Anchor out loud. Slowly. Let it sink in.  
    - Say it in the mirror if you can.
2. Inner Check-In Prompt  
    Answer this in your head or in Obsidian:  
	- “Where did I disappear today?”
	- “Where did I show up fully?”
3.   Micro-Action Toward Self
	 - One small action that’s for you, not her.  This could be a walk, journaling, finishing a task, lifting weights, sitting in silence, or choosing a different reaction.
 4. Emotional Debrief (2 mins)  
	 - Name one emotion you felt fully today. Not just what happened—what it felt like inside.  

### WEEKLY STRUCTURE ⚖️ BIG PICTURE FLOW
 - Odd Days = Action + Expression
- Even Days = Integration + Identity
#### ODD DAY PRACTICE
- Day 1: Write a “Letter to the Forgotten Me”  
    Not to Lori. To the you that’s been buried. Just let it pour out.
- Day 3: Choose One Small No  
    Say “no” to something in your life that isn’t true to you—even if it’s tiny.
- Day 5: Try Something Unfamiliar  
    This can be as simple as ordering something different, choosing different music, wearing something you normally wouldn’t.  
    You’re sending yourself the message: I am allowed to exist outside the mold.
- Day 7: Reflect + Reset  
    Look back. What felt most real? What felt like a mask?  
    What moment this week did you feel most you?

#### EVEN DAY PRACTICE (Days 2, 4, 6) [^1]
1. Inner Check-In: “Who’s driving?”
	Ask yourself:  “What part of me has been driving today? The Pleaser? The Fixer? The Disappeared One? The Boy Who Was Blamed?”  
	Just notice. No fixing. No shame. You’re building awareness.
2. Micro-Boundary Practice
	Choose one of the following based on what’s relevant that day:  
	- Say no to something minor and tolerate the discomfort.
	- Let a silence be a silence. Don’t rush to fill it.
	- If Lori gets upset or blames—practice not jumping in to fix, defend, or collapse. Just observe.
	
	These micro-boundaries build muscle. This is how you uncouple from the enmeshment.
3. “Name One Thing That’s Just Yours”
	- End the day by identifying one small thing that belonged to you today.  
	- A thought, a feeling, a preference, a choice.
	- Doesn’t need to be shared. Just recognized.
	Example: “I liked the way the sun hit the floor this morning.”, “I felt proud that I didn’t interrupt her apology.”, “I wanted quiet. That was mine.”

[^1]: Think of even days as the inner integration days—fewer prompts, more presence. These are when the roots grow quietly under the surface.
