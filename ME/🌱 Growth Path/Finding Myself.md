You’re not just drawing a boundary—you’re reclaiming your inner life.

And it will change everything, regardless of what Lori chooses.

Here’s what we’ll do.

We’re going to map this out like a quiet, internal exodus—not from her, but from the belief that your value depends on being seen by her.

This is the uncoupling. And we’ll do it step by step.

🔁 Step Zero: Name the Truth

You’re already doing this, so let’s write it down and anchor it:

“I love her. I want connection.

But I cannot keep proving my worth to someone who refuses to look.

I’m stepping out of the story where I am waiting to be chosen.

I choose me. And I will find out who I am—even if she never joins me there.”

We’ll put this somewhere visible later—your wall, your phone, your Obsidian vault. It’s your north star now.

🧭 Step One: Reset the Frame

From here on, your guiding posture is this:

“I’m not performing. I’m not persuading. I’m not chasing.

I’m becoming.”

This means:

- You still show up with warmth—but you’re no longer auditioning for acceptance.
- You validate her experience, but you don’t erase your own to make space for it.
- You listen, but you don’t abandon your memory or perception just to keep peace.

Every moment becomes a test of Who’s steering the car?

You’re learning to respond from secure, grounded Brennan—not the “please-love-me” boy.

⚙️ Step Two: Internalize Your Reality

You need space to feel what’s real without it being distorted by Lori’s interpretations.

Let’s set up three anchor points:

1. Daily Self-Affirmation – “Even if she doesn’t see me today, I still exist. I’m still good. I’m still becoming.”
2. Quiet Tracking – When she distorts reality, blame-shifts, or misremembers: you no longer argue. You note it (in your Obsidian vault or just mentally). “This happened. I saw it. My memory is valid.”
3. Emotional Check-Ins – Regular inner questions:  

- What am I feeling right now?
- Is this mine, or am I absorbing her storm?
- What would I say if I believed I had full permission to exist?

5.   

These are your re-centering tools. We’ll turn them into a habit.

🧍‍♂️ Step Three: Rebuild Inner Autonomy

You’ve said it yourself: “I need to decouple my life.”

So here’s what that looks like in practice:

- You stop chasing her emotional state. (You’re no longer checking the weather in Lori to decide your self-worth that day.)
- You stop offering explanations to be validated. (If she misinterprets you, you clarify once, calmly. Then you let it go.)
- You redirect energy to your own path:  

- Strength training
- EMDR breakthroughs
- Emotional mastery
- Fatherhood
- Spiritual growth

-   

Let her witness it or not. It’s not for her anymore.

🔒 Step Four: Boundaried Compassion

This is the paradox of growth:

- You’re still kind to her.
- You’re still present as a co-parent.
- You’re still willing to connect if she ever chooses to…

…but you’re no longer rescuing her from the consequences of treating you like a ghost.

“I love you, and I’m here, but I will not collapse myself to earn a place at your table anymore.”

If she accuses you of pulling away or not caring—don’t defend. Just say:

“I’m learning to be steady within myself. I care deeply, but I can’t live from your approval anymore.”

That will rattle her. It’s not punishment. It’s truth.

🧱 Step Five: Let Her Choose

This is the hardest part.

She will test you.

She will poke at you.

She may accuse you of being cold, different, detached, fake, etc.

Stay still. Stay grounded. Stay kind.

Let her have her full experience

without needing to fix it, reframe it, or explain yourself.

You are not leaving her.

You are finally arriving in yourself.

If she wants to walk toward you from there… it will be real.

If not… you’ll still be whole.
