## Description
---
The skill of restoring connection and emotional safety after a boundary has been crossed or ignored — without defensiveness or blame.

## Why It Matters
---
Unrepaired boundary violations erode trust and safety. Repairing them openly allows for rebuilding respect and resilience in the relationship.

## Steps
---
1. **Acknowledge the crossed boundary**  
   → Name what happened with clarity and respect.

2. **Accept responsibility or reflect on what was missed**  
   → Even if the harm wasn’t intentional, own your part.

3. **Ask or listen for the impact it had**  
   → Stay curious and humble about how the other person felt.

4. **Validate the boundary and recommit to honoring it**  
   → “That boundary matters, and I want to do better.”

5. **Clarify any confusion and offer genuine care**  
   → Be clear without defending, and end with warmth.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Getting defensive  
- Justifying the action  
- Invalidating or ignoring the boundary  
- Offering vague or hollow apologies
