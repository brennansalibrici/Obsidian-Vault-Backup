## Description
---
The intentional process of repairing emotional rupture in a relationship after disconnection, hurt, or misattunement.

## Why It Matters
---
All relationships involve rupture. Repair is what determines safety, longevity, and intimacy. Without repair, wounds deepen and disconnection becomes permanent.

## Steps
---
1. **Regulate yourself first**  
   → Pause, breathe, and make sure you're grounded enough to show up emotionally instead of reactively.

2. **Acknowledge their experience without defending**  
   → Focus on what they felt, not whether it was fair. This is about emotional attunement, not logic.

3. **Take responsibility for your impact**  
   → Even if it wasn’t intentional. This validates their experience and opens the door to healing.

4. **Express your care and desire to repair**  
   → Let them know the relationship matters to you and you're here not to win, but to reconnect.

5. **Stay present — don’t rush the fix**  
   → The repair is the presence, not the solution. Let the emotional reconnection happen in its own time.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Rushing to explain your intent
- Getting defensive or factual
- Apologizing too early without attunement
- Shutting down when they don’t respond immediately
- Using words but not showing emotional availability
