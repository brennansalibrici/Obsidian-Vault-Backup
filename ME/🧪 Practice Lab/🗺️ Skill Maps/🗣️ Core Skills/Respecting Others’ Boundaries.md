## Description
---
The ability to receive and honor another person’s boundary without protest, guilt-tripping, or emotional withdrawal.

## Why It Matters
---
Many avoidants (especially fearful and dismissive) struggle to accept “no” without feeling shame, rejection, or control. Respecting boundaries builds trust and shows maturity.

## Steps
---
1. **Listen for boundaries, even when they’re softly spoken**  
   → Be attentive to indirect “no” signals, time-outs, or bids for space.

2. **Affirm or acknowledge the boundary without reacting**  
   → “Thanks for letting me know — I hear that.”

3. **Tend to your own internal emotional response separately**  
   → Work through hurt, fear, or shame without placing it back on them.

4. **Stay relational — don’t punish or withdraw**  
   → Keep presence even when things aren’t going your way.

5. **Reflect on the boundary’s purpose and meaning with curiosity**  
   → Boundaries are not rejections — they’re invitations to safer connection.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Reacting with guilt or defensiveness  
- Collapsing into self-blame  
- Emotionally withdrawing or punishing the other person  
- Interpreting the boundary as a personal rejection  
- Repeatedly testing or dismissing the boundary
