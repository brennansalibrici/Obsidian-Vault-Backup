## Description
---
The practice of reflecting someone’s emotional experience back to them so they feel seen, understood, and safe.

## Why It Matters
---
Mirroring is foundational to emotional connection. When done well, it calms the nervous system, builds trust, and communicates deep attunement.

## Steps
---
1. **I see what’s happening in you**  
   → Recognize and name the emotion without analysis or judgment

2. **I get why it matters**  
   → Communicate that the emotion is valid in context

3. **You’re safe in here**  
   → Subtly or explicitly signal that their feeling belongs and is welcome

4. **Don’t overstep or hijack**  
   → Stay focused on *their* emotional world without inserting your own too soon

## Common Mistakes
---
- Fixing or problem-solving instead of reflecting
- Talking too much or sounding clinical
- Making it about your own feelings prematurely
- Failing to pause, soften tone, or use grounded body language
