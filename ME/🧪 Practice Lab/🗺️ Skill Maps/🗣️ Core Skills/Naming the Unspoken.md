## Description
---
The ability to gently bring voice to what no one is saying but everyone is feeling — including tension, grief, avoidance, or hidden need.

## Why It Matters
---
Unspoken emotions create disconnection, confusion, and tension. Naming them builds trust and clears space for real connection.

## Steps
---
1. **Notice the emotional undercurrent**  
   → Look for what's *not* being said: the emotional “elephant” in the room.

2. **Pause and ground yourself**  
   → Don’t speak from urgency or discomfort. Let yourself center first.

3. **Use soft, non-accusatory language to name what you feel**  
   → “I’m noticing something feels a little off here. I could be wrong, but...”

4. **Leave space for the other person to respond**  
   → Don’t fill the gap. Give them room to process or confirm what you sensed.

5. **Stay open to what unfolds — don’t force clarity**  
   → You’re opening a door, not demanding resolution.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Naming something too forcefully  
- Interpreting the unspoken thing as fact  
- Turning it into an accusation  
- Making it about your own need for relief  
- Forcing a response too quickly
