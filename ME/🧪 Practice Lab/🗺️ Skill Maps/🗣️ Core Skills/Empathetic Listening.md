## Description
---
The act of listening with full emotional presence — tracking not just words, but the feelings and meaning behind them — and making the speaker feel understood.

## Why It Matters
---
Most people don’t feel truly heard. Empathetic listening transforms communication from transactional to relational and creates emotional safety.

## Steps
---
1. **Give your full attention (body, eye contact, presence)**  
   → Turn toward, make eye contact, put distractions away, and emotionally lean in.

2. **Listen for feelings, not just facts**  
   → Don’t just process the surface message — track the tone, subtext, and nonverbals.

3. **Reflect or mirror back key emotional signals**  
   → Use short, focused phrases like “That sounds overwhelming” or “You were really hoping that would work.”

4. **Let the silence do some of the work**  
   → Resist the urge to fill every space. Give the speaker room to go deeper.

5. **Respond in a way that shows you “got it”**  
   → This might be a simple phrase, a summary of what you heard, or a validating presence. The goal is felt understanding.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Listening to respond, not to understand
