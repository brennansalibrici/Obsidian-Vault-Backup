## Description
---
The practice of affirming that someone’s emotional experience makes sense, matters, and deserves to be seen — even if you don’t fully agree or understand.

## Why It Matters
---
Without validation, people feel dismissed or misunderstood. Validation softens shame, opens trust, and creates space for deeper conversation.

## Steps
---
1. **Name the emotion they’re feeling**  
   → Mirror it back gently: “That sounds frustrating...” / “I hear how disappointed you are.”

2. **Affirm that it makes sense in context**  
   → Help them feel sane and safe: “I get why that would’ve hurt, given what you hoped for.”

3. **Reflect why it would matter to them**  
   → Speak to the personal meaning behind the feeling, not just the surface event.

4. **Show that their experience belongs with you**  
   → Let them know they’re not too much, not broken, not alone. Even a silent nod or warm look can do this.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Rushing to explain or fix
- Talking about your own emotions too soon
- Saying “I understand” without showing it
- Making it about whether you agree
- Using logic instead of presence
