## Description
---
The ability to clearly name and hold your own emotional, physical, or relational boundaries — even when doing so feels uncomfortable or risks disapproval.

## Why It Matters
---
Without maintaining your own boundaries, you become resentful, overwhelmed, or disconnected from your needs. Healthy relationships require a stable sense of self.

## Steps
---
1. **Notice the internal signal that something feels off or crossed**  
   → Learn to recognize discomfort as a boundary cue.

2. **Name the need or boundary clearly and calmly**  
   → “I need to pause here.” / “That doesn’t work for me.”

3. **Hold the boundary without collapsing, defending, or attacking**  
   → Stay grounded and repeat as needed without force.

4. **Repeat the boundary if it’s tested, without escalation**  
   → Practice consistency instead of emotional power.

5. **Tend to any internal discomfort or guilt with care**  
   → Validate your choice to stay aligned with your needs.

## Common Mistakes
---
- Apologizing for having boundaries  
- Over-explaining or intellectualizing  
- Withdrawing instead of speaking up  
- Letting guilt override self-respect  
- Waiting until you’re overwhelmed or angry
