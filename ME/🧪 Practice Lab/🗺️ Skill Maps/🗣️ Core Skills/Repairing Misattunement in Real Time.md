## Description
---
The ability to notice when you’re emotionally “off” or disconnected in a moment — and gently repair it on the spot.

## Why It Matters
---
Most emotional damage comes from subtle, unaddressed misattunement. Real-time repair preserves connection and builds deep relational trust.

## Steps
---
1. **Notice the shift in tone, emotion, or resonance**  
   → Sense when things feel “off” — silence, distancing, tension, or eye movement can all be clues.

2. **Pause and name what just happened**  
   → Gently say, “Wait — I think I just missed something” or “Did I lose you just now?”

3. **Take ownership of the miss (even if small)**  
   → Don’t explain yet — just own the moment: “That probably felt dismissive.”

4. **Reflect the other person’s emotional signal again, with care**  
   → Try again with attunement: “You were telling me something important. I want to stay with it.”

5. **Reconfirm emotional safety or connection**  
   → “Are we okay?” / “I want to make sure we’re still in this together.”

## Common Mistakes
---
- Ignoring signals of emotional disconnection
- Pretending nothing happened
- Getting defensive about “doing it wrong”
- Waiting until the other person shuts down
- Apologizing too much instead of reconnecting
