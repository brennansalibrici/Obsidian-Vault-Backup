description: The ability to hear and respond to the emotional message underneath someone’s words — even if the words sound sharp, confusing, or distant.
why_it_matters: Literal words often mask deeper needs. Without attunement, you miss emotional bids and reinforce disconnection.
level_0: Takes all words literally. Reacts to surface tone instead of emotional subtext.
level_1: Sometimes senses something deeper is going on, but gets confused or overwhelmed.
level_2: Can detect emotional meaning in hindsight. Begins to ask questions instead of react.
level_3: Pauses to listen emotionally and tries to reflect back the feeling. Developing empathy-under-language.
level_4: Consistently hears the deeper message and can name it. Responds to the feeling instead of the trigger.
level_5: Fluent in emotional language. Seamlessly tunes in and mirrors emotion without being thrown off by the words.
