## 🔍 Situation 
---
_(Describe the trig

gering event, message, or 

moment of em

otional 

tension)

_

I was visiting my sister and she a

sked me to read a bedtime story to 

her kids. My 

m

om t

ook a picture and sent it to Lori. When Lori saw it, she got deeply triggere

d and accused me of pretending to be a “good uncle” just to impress others — especially my mom — and said I never show up that way for our own kids. I was completely blindsided and didn’t even unde

rstand at first what she was upset about. I felt overwhelmed and emotionally paralyzed.

## 🌐 Why This Scenario Matters 
---
_(What makes this difficult or important to get right?)_

This type of moment is where I lose connection fast. I shut down because I didn’t agree with her story, didn’t know how to express it safely, and felt like nothing I said would make a difference. But staying present in moments like this — especially when Lori is triggered and I'm misunderstood — is critical for emotional repair and future safety.

## 🎯 Desired Growth Area  
---
_(E.g., mirroring, validation, staying present, not shutting down)

- Emotional mirroring  
- Navigating triggered shutdown  
- Naming the subtext  
- Staying with the moment without fixing  
- Responding from strength instead of helplessness_

## 🧵 Themes or Patterns  
---
_(E.g., abandonment, control, being misunderstood)_

- Feeling falsely accused  
- Feeling emotionally powerless  
- Lori’s fear of being replaced or unseen  
- My fear of trying to explain and failing  
- Disconnection when validation is needed most

## 🧩 Notes  
---
_(Optional space to capture contextual details or related observations)_

- I now realize I had a belief that “if I could just make her see what really happened, she wouldn’t feel bad” — but I’m not sure that was true.
- Her story may have had more to do with her feeling invisible or unchosen, not the photo itself.
