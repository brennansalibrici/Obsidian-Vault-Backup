## 📝 Session Summary  
---
This session explored how to respond with emotional steadiness and presence after being unexpectedly criticized and misunderstood by Lori. I practiced mirroring her feelings without defensiveness, validating her pain without agreeing with inaccurate beliefs, and staying emotionally present despite a personal trigger.

## 💡 Key Miss / Growth Edge  
---
Struggled to stay grounded and avoid slipping into “beat puppy” posture once self-doubt crept in. Over-explaining and literal rebuttal derailed emotional resonance. Lost Lori’s signal and defaulted to logic over empathy.
