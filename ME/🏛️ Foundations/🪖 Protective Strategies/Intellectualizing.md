## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Intellectualizing protects you from emotional vulnerability by shifting the focus to analysis, logic, and concepts. It helps you feel in control and competent, especially when emotions feel confusing or unsafe.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
When feelings surface that don’t have a clear solution, or when you sense judgment, shame, or emotional chaos. It also shows up when you’re asked to be emotionally present but aren’t sure how.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps create psychological distance that can bring clarity in crisis. But it blocks true emotional connection and intimacy. You might understand everything — but feel nothing.
