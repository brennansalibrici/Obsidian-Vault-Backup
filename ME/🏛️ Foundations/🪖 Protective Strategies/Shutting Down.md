## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Shutting down protects against emotional overwhelm, conflict, or perceived danger. It functions like an internal off-switch, reducing the intensity of what’s being felt by disconnecting entirely — emotionally, physically, or cognitively.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
When emotions feel too big, when someone is angry or unpredictable, or when you fear you’ll be shamed or punished for expressing your truth. Especially common after trauma or chronic invalidation.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps prevent escalation and stops you from saying or doing something regrettable. But it also blocks repair, leaves you isolated, and can feel like emotional abandonment to those you care about.
