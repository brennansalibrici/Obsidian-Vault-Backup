## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Conflict avoidance protects you from shame, anger, or abandonment. It helps you sidestep emotional chaos by keeping things smooth — often at the cost of your voice or integrity.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by tension, disagreement, or relational distance — especially if conflict used to escalate quickly or lead to emotional rupture.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can preserve short-term stability. But it builds resentment, undermines trust, and leads others to feel emotionally distant — because your truth isn’t in the room.
