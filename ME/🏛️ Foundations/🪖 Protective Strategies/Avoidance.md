## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Avoidance protects you from anticipated pain, conflict, or discomfort. It gives space, reduces anxiety, and delays confrontation when things feel too charged to manage.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered by emotional risk, perceived failure, conflict, or shame. It might look like procrastination, denial, or ghosting emotionally vulnerable spaces.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
Avoidance can regulate short-term overwhelm, but blocks necessary healing, stalls resolution, and reinforces long-term patterns of stuckness and isolation.
