## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Testing protects you from emotional abandonment or betrayal. It seeks proof that someone will stay, even in your messiness or anger.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered in moments of doubt, fear of rejection, or emotional insecurity. Often appears as picking fights, withdrawal, ultimatums, or ambiguous signals.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
Testing may temporarily confirm connection, but it often confuses others and damages safety. Trust deepens more through clear, honest need than through sabotage.
