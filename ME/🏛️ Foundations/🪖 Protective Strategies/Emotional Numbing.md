## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Emotional numbing is a buffer from overwhelming emotional intensity. It helps you function during distressing experiences and delays emotional collapse.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by intense sadness, fear, or shame — especially when emotions feel unsafe to feel. Often appears as flatness, disconnection, or inability to access emotional cues.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
While numbing may offer temporary relief and allow basic functioning, it disconnects you from joy, grief, relational attunement, and inner truth — often long after the threat has passed.
