## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Minimizing protects against feeling like a burden or overexposed. It keeps emotional intensity from escalating and shields against perceived rejection.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered by shame, emotional discomfort, or invalidation. It may look like “I’m fine,” changing the subject, or brushing things off as not a big deal.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
This can lower conflict in the moment, but often leads to unmet needs, internal resentment, and relational disconnection over time.
