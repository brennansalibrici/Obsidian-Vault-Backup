## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Persona shaping protects against judgment, exclusion, or emotional harm by constructing an identity tailored to fit the audience. It’s a mask designed to belong.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered in new environments, around authority figures, or anytime acceptance feels conditional. Often rooted in early experiences of being too much or not enough.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It creates short-term safety and belonging. But it costs true intimacy and leads to chronic self-alienation — where you’re liked, but never fully known.
