## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Overachievement protects against feelings of inadequacy, shame, or unworthiness. It keeps you constantly producing, achieving, or performing — often to prove your value or avoid facing internal doubt.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
When rest feels threatening, when you're being evaluated, or when others succeed around you. It also spikes during transitions or when your identity feels uncertain.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps build structure, resilience, and capability. But when driven by fear, it becomes a treadmill with no finish line — keeping you too busy to feel, connect, or rest.
