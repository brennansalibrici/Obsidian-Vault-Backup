## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Role locking protects you from identity confusion and emotional exposure. It helps preserve a familiar way of relating to the world — the helper, the fixer, the achiever — even when that role is outdated or limiting.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered when you feel uncertain about who you are without performing that role. Often activated during relationship shifts, job changes, or moments of emotional growth that feel destabilizing.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can provide structure, stability, and a sense of purpose. But over time, it can stifle your full self, reinforce emotional masking, and prevent authentic connection or change.
