## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Disconnection protects against emotional overwhelm, vulnerability, and the threat of being hurt or rejected. It’s often used as a shield when closeness feels unsafe or overexposure feels intolerable. This strategy creates distance to preserve internal order.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Disconnection is triggered in moments of intense emotion, perceived criticism, relational conflict, or when a person feels unseen or misunderstood. It may show up as zoning out, going blank, emotional numbing, or retreating inward during conversation.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
This strategy can be helpful in preventing emotional flooding or giving space to regroup. However, overuse leads to chronic disconnection, loneliness, and relationship strain. It may leave others feeling shut out and the self feeling isolated or emotionally flat.
