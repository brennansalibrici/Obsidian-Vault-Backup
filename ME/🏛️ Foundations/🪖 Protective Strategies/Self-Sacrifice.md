## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Self-sacrifice protects against disapproval, guilt, or moral failure. It keeps you feeling like “the good one” while silencing your deeper truth.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by relational tension, internalized duty, or fear of being seen as selfish. Often shows up as overgiving, overextension, or preemptive compliance.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
While it may maintain surface harmony, it tends to breed emotional exhaustion, resentment, and disconnection from the self.
