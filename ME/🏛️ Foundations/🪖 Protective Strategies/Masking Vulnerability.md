## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
This strategy protects your core from shame, rejection, and emotional harm by hiding what’s soft. It helps you maintain control in situations where vulnerability once felt dangerous or punished.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered in moments of intimacy, emotional exposure, or anytime you’re asked to reveal what you actually need or feel — especially if you fear being perceived as weak.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps you survive in high-risk emotional environments. But it prevents you from being truly met, supported, or loved for who you are beneath the mask.
