## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Caretaking protects against rejection, invisibility, and being perceived as a burden. It keeps you connected by focusing exclusively on others’ needs, while avoiding your own.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered when someone is in distress or upset, or when connection feels unstable. Especially strong for those taught that love must be earned through service.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can build trust and support — short term. But over time it erases your own needs, breeds resentment, and creates a relationship built on one-sided emotional labor.
