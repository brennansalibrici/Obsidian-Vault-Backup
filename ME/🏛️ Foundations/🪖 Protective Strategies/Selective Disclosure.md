## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
This strategy limits exposure by only revealing what feels safe. It avoids judgment, rejection, or vulnerability by disclosing selectively.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered by fear of misinterpretation, emotional invalidation, or historical rupture in communication. May show up as partial truths or vague phrasing.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It allows emotional control and cautious pacing — but it also creates blind spots in relationships and keeps others at an emotional distance.
