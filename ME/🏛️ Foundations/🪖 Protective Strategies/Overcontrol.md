## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Overcontrol keeps your emotional environment predictable and within manageable bounds. It protects against chaos, failure, and the fear of powerlessness.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often arises in response to unpredictability, vulnerability, or perceived chaos. Looks like micromanagement, rigidity, or difficulty with ambiguity and shared power.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It supports safety and focus when life feels overwhelming, but it blocks relational spontaneity, emotional attunement, and often creates pressure and exhaustion.
