## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Clinging protects from emotional abandonment and the panic of losing a bond. It keeps people close even when connection is shaky.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often arises during conflict, separation, or emotional ambiguity. May manifest as over-contacting, overfunctioning, or emotional pursuit.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It may preserve proximity temporarily, but can strain the relationship and diminish a sense of mutuality or self-worth.
