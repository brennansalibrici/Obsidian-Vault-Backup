## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Emotional distance helps regulate intensity and minimize risk of being overwhelmed or hurt. It provides space when closeness feels unsafe.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often emerges in conflict, criticism, shame, or relational pressure. May appear as aloofness, vagueness, or conversational disengagement.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It may offer temporary relief or clarity — but if maintained, it erodes intimacy, trust, and emotional resonance.
