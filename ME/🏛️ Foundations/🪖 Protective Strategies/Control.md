## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Control protects you from chaos, emotional unpredictability, and helplessness. It creates a buffer where you feel competent and less exposed.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
It arises when things feel out of control internally or externally — especially during conflict, transition, or interpersonal ambiguity.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps with focus and emotional regulation short-term but may prevent growth, creativity, and authentic partnership over time.
