## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
This strategy protects against the pain of unmet needs, disappointment, and dependence on others who might let you down. It gives a sense of control and emotional containment when vulnerability feels dangerous.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by old experiences of rejection, invalidation, or inconsistent caregiving. Often shows up as “I’ve got it,” downplaying needs, or emotionally withdrawing in stress.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
Self-reliance may foster strength and functionality, but over time it starves emotional connection and reinforces the belief that you’re on your own. It blocks the growth of safe mutuality.
