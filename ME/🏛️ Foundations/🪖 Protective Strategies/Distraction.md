## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Distraction protects you from emotional pain by redirecting your attention. It helps you bypass difficult feelings like sadness, shame, or fear by giving your brain something else to focus on.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered by silence, emotional buildup, or any moment when uncomfortable feelings rise to the surface. It’s especially strong when there’s no safe outlet for what you're feeling.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can be a short-term tool to prevent overwhelm or buy time to regulate. But overuse turns into emotional avoidance and can delay healing — leaving pain unprocessed and stuck.
