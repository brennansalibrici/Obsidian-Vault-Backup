## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Guardedness protects your core self from potential rejection, judgment, or abandonment. It builds walls to reduce risk and maintain control of emotional exposure.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
It’s triggered when vulnerability feels unsafe — especially around emotional closeness, intimacy, or perceived criticism. Often shows up as withholding, minimal sharing, or deflection.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps maintain emotional safety and personal boundaries short-term, but it creates barriers to authentic connection and may leave you feeling lonely and misunderstood.
