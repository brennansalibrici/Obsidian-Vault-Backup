## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Hypervigilance protects against surprise harm, betrayal, or failure by keeping you constantly alert to potential threat. It reads tone, posture, silence — everything — trying to stay one step ahead.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by uncertainty, relational tension, authority figures, or reminders of past betrayal. Common in trauma survivors or those raised in emotionally unsafe environments.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can keep you sharp and aware of real patterns. But it creates exhaustion, anxiety, and relational misfires — seeing danger where there is none, and preventing rest even when you're safe.
