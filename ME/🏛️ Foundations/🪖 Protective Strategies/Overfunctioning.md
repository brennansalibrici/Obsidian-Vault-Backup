## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Overfunctioning protects against chaos, disapproval, or abandonment. It keeps you in control of outcomes by taking on too much — often at the cost of your health and needs.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered when others seem unreliable, when you're under pressure, or when perfectionism kicks in. Especially strong in caretaking roles or relationships where failure was unsafe.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It ensures things get done and can feel stabilizing. But it fosters resentment, burnout, and emotional isolation — leaving you feeling alone, unseen, and over-responsible.
