## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Testing loyalty shields against betrayal or abandonment. It’s a way to demand evidence of care without exposing the underlying fear.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by uncertainty in connection or perceived threat to the bond. May show up as manufactured tests, exaggerated withdrawal, or silent treatment.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It offers indirect clarity but can confuse and exhaust others. Emotional honesty is a more nourishing path toward security.
