## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Reassurance seeking protects from emotional abandonment and the panic of not knowing where you stand. It soothes anxiety through verbal or physical affirmation.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Triggered by emotional disconnection, fear of loss, or internal uncertainty. It may show up as repeated questioning, checking in, or asking for repeated confirmation of care.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
This can help regulate panic temporarily, but long-term it erodes trust in your own internal signals and can exhaust relationships if not balanced with grounded self-attunement.
