## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Emotional flooding protects against the buildup of unexpressed pain. It pushes everything out — all at once — as a way of discharging distress and preventing internal implosion.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered by emotional disconnection, accumulated stress, or when vulnerability hasn’t felt welcome or heard for too long.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It brings temporary relief and visibility. But it can overwhelm others, damage connection, and reinforce the idea that your emotions are “too much.”
