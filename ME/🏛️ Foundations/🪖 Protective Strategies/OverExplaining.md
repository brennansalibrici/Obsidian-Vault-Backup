## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Overexplaining protects against rejection, conflict, and being misunderstood. It creates a false sense of control over how others perceive you — driven by fear that if you don't explain *everything*, they'll leave, judge, or shame you.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
In moments of emotional exposure, tension, or when someone seems upset or confused. It often shows up in relationships where you've historically felt blamed, misread, or punished for being yourself.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It may temporarily diffuse conflict or buy clarity. But it often floods the moment, exhausts you, and obscures the emotional truth underneath. You might end up sounding convincing — but feeling unseen.
