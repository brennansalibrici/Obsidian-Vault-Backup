## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
People-pleasing protects your connection to others by ensuring you’re seen as agreeable, likable, and helpful — often at the cost of your own boundaries. It shields against rejection, abandonment, or judgment by becoming what others want.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
In moments of tension, criticism, or emotional distance. It flares when others are disappointed, angry, or hard to read — and especially when love has felt conditional in the past.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps preserve social harmony and reduces short-term conflict. But over time, it breeds resentment, self-erasure, and emotional dishonesty. You may stay liked — but feel invisible.
