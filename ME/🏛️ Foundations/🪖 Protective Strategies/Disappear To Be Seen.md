## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
It protects from rejection while expressing a silent plea to be noticed. It attempts to be seen through absence when presence feels unsafe.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered when efforts to connect are missed or misunderstood. May look like shutting down, going quiet, or withholding participation.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
Can express longing subtly but often gets misread or ignored — reinforcing the wound. Recovery involves reclaiming the right to be present and vocal.
