## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Sarcasm protects by masking emotional truth with humor, irony, or sharpness. It deflects vulnerability and shields you from appearing soft, affected, or exposed. It's a way of “saying without saying.”

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
When you feel awkward, emotionally vulnerable, or uncertain how your truth will land. Especially common in moments of shame, tension, or grief.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can lighten emotional weight and offer humor in tension. But it often confuses others, blocks depth, and leaves the real need unspoken. It may protect your pride — but at the cost of being known.
