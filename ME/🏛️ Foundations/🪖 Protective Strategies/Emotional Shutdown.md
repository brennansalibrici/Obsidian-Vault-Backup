## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Emotional shutdown protects against overwhelm, shame, and vulnerability. It cuts off access to feeling as a way of staying functional when emotion feels threatening or unmanageable.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often activated during conflict, relational rupture, or when your emotions start to feel “too much” — especially if you were punished for feeling growing up.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can help you survive emotionally unsafe environments. But over time, it numbs joy, blocks intimacy, and convinces others (and yourself) that you’re unaffected — when you’re actually just armored.
