## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
The Fixer protects against helplessness, rejection, and internal feelings of inadequacy by jumping into action. It maintains a sense of worth by becoming needed.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
In response to others’ pain, emotional messiness, or chaos. Especially strong when you were taught love meant being useful — not present.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It can provide short-term solutions. But it often invalidates deeper pain, creates emotional disconnection, and reinforces the belief that you're only valuable when doing.
