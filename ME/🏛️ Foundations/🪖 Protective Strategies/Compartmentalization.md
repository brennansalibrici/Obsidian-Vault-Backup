## 🛡️ What This Strategy Protects
---
Compartmentalization protects you from being emotionally overwhelmed by separating feelings from tasks. It allows you to keep functioning when there’s too much going on inside.

## ⚠️ When It Gets Triggered
---
Often triggered in high-stress situations, caregiving roles, leadership responsibilities, or trauma responses — when emotional expression feels unsafe or inconvenient.

## 🔄 When It Helps / When It Hurts
---
It helps you stay grounded and capable under pressure. But it fractures your inner world if never revisited, and can lead to emotional detachment, disconnection, and burnout.
