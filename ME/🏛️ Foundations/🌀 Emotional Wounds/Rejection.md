## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
Rejection wounds often form in childhood when love, presence, or approval was withheld in moments of emotional need. It might also result from outright dismissal, shaming, or being pushed away â€” especially when one was most vulnerable.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
Rejection wounds can manifest as hypervigilance for signs of disapproval, fear of being excluded, or chronic efforts to win people over. They may trigger intense shame or over-accommodation in the face of even gentle critique.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing this wound involves experiencing consistent, accepting relationships where disagreement or difference doesn't result in abandonment. Practicing secure boundaries and reclaiming inherent worth are part of the path.
