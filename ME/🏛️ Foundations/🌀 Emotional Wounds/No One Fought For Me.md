## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when others stood by â€” silent or powerless â€” while you were hurt, dismissed, or in distress. You were left to advocate for yourself too early, or not at all.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel a deep grief under your independence, or a rage that emerges when people fail to show up. You may refuse help even when itâ€™s safe â€” because the help never came when it mattered.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing begins when someone finally *does* show up â€” without you having to scream or beg. Letting yourself be protected, slowly and on your terms, can begin to soften the belief that no one ever will.
