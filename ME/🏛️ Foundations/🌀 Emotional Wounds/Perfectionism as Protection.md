## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
When love, safety, or approval are conditional, perfectionism becomes armor. If mistakes were punished, achievements were your worth, or flaws were weaponized, you learned: “If I’m perfect, I won’t get hurt.”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel driven, anxious, or empty — constantly chasing “enough.” Mistakes feel catastrophic. You hide needs, deny rest, or push past limits to avoid the shame of being seen as weak or messy.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Perfectionism loses power when you meet your messiness with love. Let yourself be seen *before* you’re polished. Practice imperfection in safe spaces. The goal isn’t to be flawless — it’s to be whole.
