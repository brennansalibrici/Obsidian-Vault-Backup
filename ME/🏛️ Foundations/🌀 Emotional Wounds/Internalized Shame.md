## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Internalized shame arises when a child consistently receives the message that their feelings, needs, or being are “too much,” “not enough,” or “wrong.” It’s not just about *doing* something wrong — it’s the belief that *you* are wrong.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
A constant sense of unworthiness, fear of exposure, or compulsive self-correction. You might over-apologize, sabotage joy, or believe love must be earned through perfection, achievement, or self-denial.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Meeting shame with tenderness instead of self-punishment. Naming it aloud, with safe witnesses, begins to dissolve its hold. The antidote to shame isn’t pride — it’s presence. “I see you. And I’m still here.”
