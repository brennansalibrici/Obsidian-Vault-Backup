## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Judgment wounds form when your feelings, identity, desires, or body were repeatedly criticized or pathologized. You may have been told you were “too much,” “not enough,” “weird,” or “wrong” — often by the very people whose acceptance mattered most.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may second-guess everything, live in fear of what others think, or preemptively shrink yourself to avoid being attacked. Internalized judgment becomes a voice that lives inside, not just outside.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
You must begin to unlearn the lie that you’re defective. Healing this wound is not about proving yourself — it’s about *freeing* yourself. Your truth isn’t a problem to fix. It’s a gift to reclaim.
