## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when expressing needs was met with irritation, withdrawal, or guilt trips — as if your existence was too much. It leaves a lasting imprint: “I’m only safe if I disappear.”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may over-function, avoid asking for help, or apologize constantly. You might believe your presence or feelings are inherently disruptive — no matter how gently you show up.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing this wound means experiencing your needs as welcome — not costly. It takes relationships where care is freely offered and not framed as sacrifice.
