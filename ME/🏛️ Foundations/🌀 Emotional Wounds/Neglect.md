## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
Neglect wounds form in environments where caregivers were physically present but emotionally unavailable â€” or where attunement was consistently absent. It creates a silent ache: the pain of *not being seen*.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
Neglect often leads to difficulty identifying or naming feelings, internalized beliefs of unworthiness, and chronic loneliness â€” even in relationships. You may under-express your needs or question whether you even have the right to them.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing begins with learning to notice and honor your own emotional reality. Gentle presence, consistent care, and permission to take up space help restore the belief that your inner life matters.
