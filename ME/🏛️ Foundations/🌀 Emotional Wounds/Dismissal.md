## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when emotional pain, excitement, or vulnerability was consistently dismissed — through phrases like “you’re too sensitive” or “get over it.” It teaches that your inner world is inconvenient or unworthy of care.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may chronically invalidate yourself, silence emotional needs, or defer to others’ feelings as more legitimate. Expressing real emotion can feel embarrassing or unsafe.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
This wound softens through gentle attunement, affirming your experience *before* trying to solve it. Being mirrored by safe people and practicing emotional expression restores dignity to your inner life.
