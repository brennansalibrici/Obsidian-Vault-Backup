## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound often begins in environments where your choices didn’t matter — where you were overruled, dismissed, or forced to comply. Whether through trauma, authoritarian parenting, or systemic oppression, you learned that your agency was irrelevant or dangerous.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may freeze under pressure, struggle to make decisions, or feel trapped by even small moments of uncertainty. You might oscillate between helplessness and control-seeking, trying to escape the feeling of being powerless again.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Rebuild trust in your ability to respond. Begin with small choices — not to control the world, but to re-enter it. Your voice matters. Your “yes” and “no” matter. Power doesn’t mean domination — it means *presence with agency*.
