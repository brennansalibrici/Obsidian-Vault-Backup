## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when personal boundaries were blurred â€” often by a parent relying on the child for emotional support, identity, or stability. Your sense of self became fused with someone elseâ€™s emotional needs or narrative.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may struggle to know where *you* end and others begin. Choices feel guilt-laden. You might shape-shift around others' emotions, feel responsible for their well-being, or lose touch with your own wants.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing enmeshment involves reclaiming personal identity, honoring boundaries, and practicing self-differentiation. You learn that closeness doesnâ€™t require absorption â€” you can stay *connected* and still be *you*.
