## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
Loss is the pain of having once held something â€” or someone â€” meaningful, only to have it taken away. It might be a death, a divorce, a sudden change, or even the slow vanishing of something once sacred. Loss wounds us because it points to what mattered.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may fear loving again, rush to replace whatâ€™s gone, or numb yourself to avoid feeling the ache. Loss can also make joy feel dangerous â€” as if allowing something in means preparing for it to leave.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Grief is the medicine. Naming what was lost â€” fully and without shame â€” allows you to metabolize the pain rather than carry it unprocessed. Letting yourself *feel* is the first step toward letting yourself *love* again.
