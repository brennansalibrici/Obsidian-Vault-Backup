## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when you were repeatedly shamed — for feelings, desires, mistakes, or traits you couldn’t control. Shame was used to regulate your behavior rather than attunement or compassion.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may preemptively shrink, self-monitor, or silence yourself to avoid judgment. You may expect humiliation in moments of vulnerability and carry deep internalized narratives of defectiveness.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing shame involves safe witnessing — being seen in your imperfection without condemnation. It also requires confronting internalized shame voices and learning self-compassion as resistance.
