## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when a child consistently feels like an outsider — in their family, culture, faith, or peer group. You may have been the “different one,” the emotional one, the quiet one, the questioning one — and that difference was not welcomed, mirrored, or valued.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may over-adapt in social spaces, fear exclusion deeply, or sacrifice authenticity for approval. Even in a room full of people, you might feel profoundly alone. This longing is not just about community — it’s about *home*.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
You must begin to belong to yourself. Reclaim the parts you exiled to fit in. Seek spaces where your whole self — messy, tender, questioning — is welcome. Healing happens in brave spaces, not perfect ones.
