## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Abandonment occurs when someone you depended on emotionally or physically leaves — whether through absence, death, withdrawal, or neglect. It can be sudden or chronic, visible or invisible. What matters is the rupture: the felt experience of “you’re gone, and I’m not okay.”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel panicked at the first sign of distance, assume disconnection means rejection, or over-function in relationships to avoid being left. There can also be numbness — a refusal to need anyone at all, masked as independence.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Abandonment heals in connection. Safe, consistent relationships rewire the panic. Self-trust deepens when you stay with your own needs instead of abandoning them to avoid abandonment by others.
