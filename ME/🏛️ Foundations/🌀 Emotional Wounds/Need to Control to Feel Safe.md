## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Control becomes a protective strategy when the world around you is unstable, inconsistent, or threatening. If caregivers were unpredictable or unsafe, your nervous system learned: “If I don’t control it, I’ll get hurt.”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may micromanage your environment, relationships, or even emotions. Uncertainty feels like danger. Letting go — of a plan, a role, a dynamic — triggers anxiety or collapse.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Safety must be rebuilt from the inside out. Practice small surrenders. Reframe control as a signal — not a solution. Healing means trusting your ability to *respond* to life, not just brace against it.
