## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound emerges when significant people â€” especially caregivers or partners â€” repeatedly made commitments and failed to follow through. It erodes your ability to trust consistency or words of reassurance.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may grow suspicious when others offer support, resist dependence, or constantly prepare for letdowns. Promises may feel like traps instead of comfort.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
This wound heals slowly through trustworthy presence â€” people who show up without fanfare and follow through without pressure. Trust builds not from grand gestures, but quiet consistency.
