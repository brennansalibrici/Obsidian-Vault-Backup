## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when love, attention, or approval was offered only when you were compliant, successful, attractive, or emotionally restrained. The message received is: “You are lovable only *if*…”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may fear being your full self, worry you'll be left if you're not "good," and struggle with people-pleasing or perfectionism. Authentic connection feels risky — like it could cost you everything.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing comes through being loved as you are — not for what you produce or manage. It may also involve grieving the love you didn’t receive, and separating your worth from your performance.
