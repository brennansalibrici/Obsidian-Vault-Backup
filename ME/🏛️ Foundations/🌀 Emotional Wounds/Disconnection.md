## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Disconnection happens when your inner world isn’t met, mirrored, or responded to. It can come from caregivers who were present physically but unavailable emotionally — or from being raised in an environment where true emotional presence was rare.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel numb, isolated, or unseen even in close relationships. You might struggle to name what you feel, or feel emotionally distant from your own experiences. The wound says: “No one is really here.”

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Connection begins by turning toward yourself. Slow down. Name what’s real inside. Seek relationships where mutual presence — not just proximity — is possible. You are not too much. You were just too *unmet*.
