## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound takes root when your needs, voice, or presence were overlooked — not necessarily through cruelty, but neglect. If you learned to disappear to stay safe, be helpful, or avoid being “a problem,” invisibility became your survival story.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may hesitate to speak, defer to others, or struggle to believe your perspective matters. You might feel lonely in crowds, invisible in partnerships, or unsure you even deserve attention.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Reclaim your place. Begin to occupy space in your own life — your feelings, preferences, voice. Let visibility feel awkward at first. The world can’t mirror what you keep hidden. Your presence matters.
