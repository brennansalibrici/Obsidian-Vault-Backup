## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms in environments where vulnerability was equated with failure or inferiority — often through subtle messaging or outright ridicule. It teaches you to fear emotional softness and equate power with distance.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may overcompensate, hide pain, or armor yourself emotionally. Being seen in a vulnerable state can feel like a setup for judgment or betrayal.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing means redefining strength — not as stoicism, but as grounded presence. When you are met with respect in moments of softness, this wound begins to lose its grip.
