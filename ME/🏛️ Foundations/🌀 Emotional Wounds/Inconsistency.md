## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when emotional support came unpredictably — sometimes warm, sometimes withdrawn, without explanation. It leaves you perpetually guessing: “Will this love stay?”

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel anxious in close relationships, hyper-sensitive to tone changes, or suspicious of emotional shifts. Safety feels temporary — as though it must be earned again and again.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Repairing this wound means anchoring in stable, emotionally honest relationships where repair follows rupture. Consistency in presence, not perfection, is what rebuilds trust.
