## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
Shame is the internal scar left by chronic exposure to disapproval, humiliation, or conditional love. It’s not just that you did something wrong — it’s the belief that you *are* wrong. Shame flourishes when you are met with contempt instead of curiosity.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel like you’re never enough, hide your true self, or punish yourself before others can. Even joy may feel suspicious — like it’s something you haven’t earned.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Shame dissolves in safe exposure. Let someone see you — messy, raw, and still trying. Speak your truth in spaces that hold it gently. The wound says “you’re bad.” Healing whispers back: “You’re still worthy.”
