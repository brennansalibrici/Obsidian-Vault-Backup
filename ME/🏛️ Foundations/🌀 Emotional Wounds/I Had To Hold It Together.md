## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound stems from being placed in a caregiving or stabilizing role as a child — emotionally responsible for others' well-being. You were never allowed to fall apart.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel guilty resting, avoid asking for help, or collapse only when no one is looking. You carry everyone else — but rarely let yourself be carried.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
The wound begins to mend when you are allowed to be messy, needy, or human without consequence. Letting go of the “strong one” identity can free up space for your own healing.
