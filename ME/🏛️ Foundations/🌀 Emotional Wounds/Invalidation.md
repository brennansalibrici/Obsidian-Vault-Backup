## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound takes root when your emotions were dismissed, mocked, or treated as exaggerated. You were taught â€” subtly or overtly â€” that your inner world was unreliable or wrong.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may invalidate yourself before anyone else can, minimize your own pain, or apologize for having needs. Conflict can feel impossible to navigate without retreat or collapse.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
The healing path involves learning to validate your own experience without external permission. Being mirrored by emotionally attuned others supports this transformation.
