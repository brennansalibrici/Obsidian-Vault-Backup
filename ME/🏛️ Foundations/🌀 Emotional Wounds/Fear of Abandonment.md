## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
Rooted in early experiences of emotional or physical separation â€” especially if those departures were inconsistent, unpredictable, or shaming. Whether through a caregiver leaving, withdrawing love, or being emotionally unavailable, the nervous system internalized that connection is fragile and unsafe.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may cling to relationships, feel constant anxiety about being left, or preemptively sabotage intimacy. Even minor distance can feel like rejection. This fear often drives fawning, over-explaining, or emotional shapeshifting.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Learning to anchor internally. You must build the inner knowing that connection lost is not always connection gone. Self-soothing, nervous system regulation, and secure relationships where repair is modeled are key. You are not abandoned â€” you are *becoming home* to yourself.
