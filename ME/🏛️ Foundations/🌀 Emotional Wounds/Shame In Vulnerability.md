## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when emotional expression was met with ridicule, silence, or punishment. Tears were embarrassing. Asking for help made you weak. Softness became dangerous.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may instinctively mask tenderness, flinch away from empathy, or over-intellectualize your inner world. You might wait until alone to cry â€” if you let yourself cry at all.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing starts when vulnerability is honored instead of judged. Being seen in your softness â€” and gently stayed with â€” begins to rewire the belief that vulnerability = shame.
