## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound often develops in families where conflict meant danger: yelling, stonewalling, blame, or withdrawal. If disagreement led to rupture, punishment, or guilt-tripping, your system learned to avoid it at all costs â€” equating conflict with the end of connection or safety.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may go silent, appease, or placate to avoid confrontation. Even minor disagreement can spike panic or shame. You might fear youâ€™ll lose people if you speak honestly, so you swallow your truth.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Reframing conflict as a *form* of connection, not its end. Learn to tolerate tension without collapse. Start small: express preferences, hold boundaries, speak disappointment gently. Over time, conflict becomes survivable â€” even sacred.
