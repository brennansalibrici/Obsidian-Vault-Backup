## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound emerges when a parent, partner, or friend emotionally shifted focus away from you toward someone else â€” without acknowledgment or repair. It can feel like being erased while still standing there.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may struggle with jealousy, comparison, or a deep fear that your place is conditional. Even small shifts in attention can feel threatening. You're always watching for signs that youâ€™re being replaced.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
This wound heals through secure attachment and clear reassurance. When others hold space for your value even in the presence of others, your sense of emotional permanence starts to grow.
