## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound occurs when autonomy, privacy, or emotional space was repeatedly invaded. Your inner life wasnâ€™t yours â€” it was managed, criticized, or overwritten by others.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You might overanalyze every decision, defer to others constantly, or rebel from all control. Boundaries may feel unsafe â€” either too rigid or too porous.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Healing begins with reclaiming agency. Learning to feel, choose, and assert boundaries without guilt helps build trust in your own internal compass.
