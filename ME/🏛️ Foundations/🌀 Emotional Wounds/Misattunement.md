## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound arises when caregivers didnâ€™t reflect or respond to your emotional states â€” not because of cruelty, but because they couldnâ€™t see you clearly. Your feelings were often missed, misnamed, or ignored.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may feel like no one "gets" you or that connection always includes distortion. You might downplay your emotional experiences or find yourself unsure of what you really feel.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
Relational repair is central here. Healing occurs when someone finally sees and names your emotional experience accurately. Internal attunement builds as your feelings are welcomed instead of dismissed.
