## ðŸ©¸ What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound stems from early or repeated exposure to environments that felt unsafe â€” emotionally, physically, or relationally. It may involve witnessing or enduring chaos, aggression, addiction, or emotional unpredictability.

## ðŸ’¥ How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may find yourself on edge even in calm moments, interpreting neutrality as threat. Trust and relaxation may feel dangerous. Your nervous system may be locked in alert mode, expecting disruption.

## ðŸ§ª What Healing Might Involve
---
This wound begins to heal when safety is redefined as predictable, not controlling. Co-regulation, nervous system repair, and slow-building relational safety are key.
