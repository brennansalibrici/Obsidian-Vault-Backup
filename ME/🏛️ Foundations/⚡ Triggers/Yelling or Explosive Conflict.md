## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Fight/flight/freeze responses — including physical tension, emotional flooding, or immediate dissociation. It can evoke helplessness, terror, or rage depending on your wiring.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Most often tied to experiences where conflict felt dangerous — either emotionally (shaming, blame) or physically. Loud volume = threat, especially if no repair followed.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Ground and remind yourself: “Volume isn’t always violence — but I’ve been trained to hear it that way.” If safe, step away and return later. Build capacity by repairing small conflicts calmly over time.
