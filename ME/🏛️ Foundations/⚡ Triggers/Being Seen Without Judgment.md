definition: The emotional vulnerability that surfaces when you’re fully seen — flaws, feelings, needs — and fear being judged, rejected, or shamed in response. This is not a trigger of actual judgment, but the possibility of it in the face of exposure.

## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
A flood of shame, defensiveness, or self-doubt. You may feel raw, exposed, or like you’re holding your breath waiting to be hurt. It can quickly flip into self-protection — shutting down, lashing out, or masking your truth to avoid judgment.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This trigger often develops in environments where authenticity was met with critique, control, or emotional punishment. If showing vulnerability or need in childhood led to rejection or ridicule, the nervous system registers being seen as inherently unsafe — no matter how loving the gaze might be now.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Recognize that the fear doesn’t mean danger is present — only that your system *remembers* a time when it was. Breathe into the discomfort. Say inwardly: “It’s okay to be seen. I’m not doing anything wrong.” Let trust build through small, repeated moments of safe exposure — where being seen leads to *connection*, not harm.
