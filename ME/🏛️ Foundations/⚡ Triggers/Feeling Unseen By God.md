## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Existential sorrow, spiritual despair, or deep aloneness. It may also stir guilt, anger, or spiritual confusion. You may feel like a child reaching for a parent who doesn’t turn around.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This can stem from early teachings that framed God as conditional, absent, or punishing — or from real pain that seemed unanswered. The nervous system pairs neglect or pain with divine silence.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Meet it like grief. Cry *with* it. Let lament and questioning become prayer. Remind yourself: “The silence isn’t proof of absence.” Invite warmth, comfort, or mystery — not answers.
