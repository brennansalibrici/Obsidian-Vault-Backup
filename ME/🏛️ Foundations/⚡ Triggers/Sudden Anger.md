## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
You may freeze, dissociate, scan the room for danger, or rush to calm the angry person. Your body might tighten before your mind catches up. Even small outbursts can feel huge.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often rooted in environments where anger signaled threat or danger — especially if it was paired with punishment, silence, or chaos. Your system still treats intensity as imminent harm.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Start by grounding in your body — move, breathe, name sensations. Give yourself permission to leave or take space. Later, explore whether the anger truly threatens you now — or echoes something from then.
