## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Panic, urgency, helplessness, or even rage. It can make you feel like you’re failing, or like your own emotional ground is slipping. May trigger overfunctioning, caretaking, or emotional withdrawal.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This often connects to early experiences where you had to be emotionally responsible for others — or where others’ pain overwhelmed your sense of safety. The nervous system may equate witnessing pain with danger or duty.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Pause and separate: “Their pain is real — and I don’t have to fix it to care.” Focus on presence over solutions. Offer grounded empathy instead of urgency. Sometimes, just *staying* is the healing act.
