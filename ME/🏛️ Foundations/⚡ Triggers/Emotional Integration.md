## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Disorientation, shame, or fear of “getting it wrong.” It can feel like cognitive or emotional vertigo — a panic that there’s no clear right answer, or that you’ll be punished for holding complexity.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often rooted in perfectionist or black-and-white emotional systems where only one feeling, truth, or identity could be safe at a time. Integration feels like a threat to stability or belonging.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Use the anchor: “It’s both.” Let contradiction be a signal of growth, not confusion. Speak aloud: “I can feel love and anger at the same time.” Integration is a sign of maturity, not failure.
