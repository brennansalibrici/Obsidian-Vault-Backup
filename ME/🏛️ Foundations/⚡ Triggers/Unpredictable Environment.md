## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Hypervigilance, irritability, or freeze. It can make your nervous system feel like it must stay “on guard” or guess what’s coming next. Often paired with control-seeking behavior.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Usually connected to unstable or chaotic childhood environments — where routines, moods, or rules were inconsistent. Predictability became a lifeline for emotional safety.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Create internal anchors: breath, routines, grounding practices. Use affirming cues: “I don’t have to predict everything to be safe.” Focus on what you *can* count on, even in small ways.
