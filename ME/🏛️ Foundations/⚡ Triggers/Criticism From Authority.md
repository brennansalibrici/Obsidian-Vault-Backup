## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Shame, defensiveness, and a collapse into self-doubt or rage. The nervous system may interpret it as a threat to belonging, approval, or survival. It can lead to either fawning or rebellion.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often linked to childhood experiences of authoritarian parenting, high-stakes performance environments, or being punished for not meeting expectations. This trigger fuses identity with evaluation.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Separate the message from the tone or delivery. Ask: “Is this about me now, or about who I used to be?” Regulate first, then revisit the content with discernment. Validate your worth *before* assessing accuracy.
