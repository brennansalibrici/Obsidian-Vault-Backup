  When someone’s tone feels flat, sarcastic, or uninterested, I quickly interpret it as rejection or dismissal, even if the words themselves aren’t negative.

## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Immediate irritation, hurt, or shutdown. It often bypasses logic and cuts straight to feeling small, mocked, or disregarded. Can cause mental spiraling or emotional disengagement.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often rooted in childhood experiences of sarcasm, ridicule, or subtle belittling. The nervous system associates certain tones with emotional danger or loss of dignity.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Pause before reacting. Clarify internally: “Did they *mean* to dismiss me, or does this tone remind me of someone who did?” Ask for clarification if safe. Set boundaries if the pattern persists.
