## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Gaslighting can trigger intense self-doubt, confusion, or even terror. You may feel desperate to prove your version of events, or you may collapse into silence, unsure whether your perceptions are trustworthy.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often originates in manipulative or narcissistic relationships — romantic, familial, or professional — where control was maintained by undermining your confidence in your own memory or truth.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Write down what you remember. Say your truth out loud — even to yourself. Let safe others mirror back reality. Ground in sensation and affirm: "My experience is valid, even if someone else denies it."
