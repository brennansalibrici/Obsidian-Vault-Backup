## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
You may feel paralyzed, trapped, or intensely anxious. No response feels safe. Whether you speak or stay silent, act or don’t act, the outcome feels emotionally costly.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This is often rooted in relationships where authority figures (especially caregivers) made love or acceptance conditional on compliance, even when their expectations were contradictory or unclear.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Start by validating that the bind is real — you’re not crazy or overly sensitive. Explore each message separately, name their conflict, and practice trusting your inner alignment even when no response feels "right."
