  When I express something I need—whether emotional, physical, or logistical—and it’s downplayed, dismissed, or forgotten, it hits something deep in me that says: you don’t matter, stop asking.

## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Feelings of invisibility, worthlessness, and suppressed rage. It can cause shutdown, overexplanation, or emotional withdrawal. Internally, it often reinforces the belief that “my needs are too much.”

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This is often rooted in developmental wounds where emotional expression was dismissed or seen as inconvenient. Caregivers may have modeled emotional suppression, invalidation, or chronic misattunement.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Reclaim the right to have needs. Begin by validating them to yourself. If safe, name the pattern: “When I feel brushed aside, I start to believe I don’t deserve care. But I do.” Make space for the unmet need without shame.
