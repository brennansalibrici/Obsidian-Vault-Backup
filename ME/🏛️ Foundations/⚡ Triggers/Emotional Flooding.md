## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Panic, numbness, withdrawal, or emotional collapse. The system shifts into survival mode — thoughts race or disappear, and the urge to shut down or escape becomes urgent.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Flooding often reflects a nervous system that's been stretched beyond its capacity to feel safely. It's common in trauma survivors or those who learned to suppress emotion until it bursts. Body-stored emotional residue makes even small emotional waves feel tsunami-like.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Soften everything. Lower stimulation. Use breath, temperature, or rhythm to anchor. Don’t try to *understand* or *solve* while flooded — your only job is to return to regulation. Later, reflect gently on what it stirred up.
