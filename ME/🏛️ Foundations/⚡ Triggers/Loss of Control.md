## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Anxiety, panic, or attempts to micromanage. It can lead to disorientation, irritability, or a desperate need to regain order — sometimes through overcorrection or withdrawal.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This is frequently tied to early experiences of chaos, unpredictability, or being placed in roles without support. Control becomes a protective adaptation for feeling safe in a world that once felt unsafe.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Acknowledge the fear beneath the grasping. Ground in the body: “What can I *actually* influence right now?” Shift from control to containment — trust that you can handle, even if you can’t control.
