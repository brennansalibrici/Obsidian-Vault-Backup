## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Hurt, resentment, or anger. Often accompanied by a collapsing sensation — as if your voice, presence, or reality doesn’t matter. It may stir inner protest or retreat.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Usually tied to experiences of emotional neglect, dismissal, or being told your perspective was wrong, exaggerated, or unimportant. Can echo wounds around invisibility and unmet validation needs.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Breathe into the discomfort and affirm: “My experience is valid even if it’s not received.” You can reassert your truth calmly or protect your energy by disengaging when repeated misattunement occurs.
