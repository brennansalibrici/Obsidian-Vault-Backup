## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
This trigger stirs up panic, helplessness, or shutdown. It can bring a visceral fear of being left behind, erased, or replaced. Even small signs of disconnection can feel catastrophic, evoking a desperate need to prevent the feared abandonment.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
It often stems from early attachment ruptures — such as inconsistent caregiving, emotional neglect, or an experience of being left when support was needed most. It may also echo traumatic relational losses from adolescence or adulthood.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Name the fear out loud when safe to do so. Anchor in present reality: "I'm not that child anymore," or "This is a feeling, not a fact." Lean on co-regulation, body grounding, or reaching out to a safe person rather than scrambling to prevent loss through old protective strategies.
