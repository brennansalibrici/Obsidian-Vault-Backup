## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
This trigger generates internal chaos — thoughts scatter, feelings contradict each other, and clarity disappears. You may feel frozen, agitated, or desperate for someone to help you make sense of the moment.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
It often roots in environments where your reality was denied, experiences were invalidated, or truth shifted unpredictably. You may have been punished for asking questions or told to "just deal with it" in the face of inconsistency.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Slow everything down. Start naming small pieces of what you *do* know. Anchoring to sensation, breath, or one coherent part of your inner world can help restore orientation. External validation from safe people is often essential.
