## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Tension, avoidance, or a sharp internal retreat. You might feel frozen, exposed, or defensive — like their softness demands something you're afraid to offer or reveal.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Softness may not have been safe growing up — either dismissed, punished, or mocked. If vulnerability led to shame or rejection, your body might respond to gentleness with fear or suspicion.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Breathe. Remind yourself: “This is not a trap — it’s an invitation.” You don’t have to match their vulnerability right away. Just notice your impulse, stay curious, and soften inwardly as you’re able.
