## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Intense emotional flashbacks, even if the present situation doesn’t *seem* traumatic. You might feel trapped, powerless, or panicked without knowing why. It may come with disorientation or déjà vu.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
When past trauma goes unprocessed, present events that “feel similar” can pull the body and emotions into reliving the old wound. The nervous system responds as if the past is happening now.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Say aloud or write: “This is a *reminder*, not a repetition.” Anchor in the present moment — look around, name objects, move your body. If the old wound resurfaces, it may be asking for repair.
