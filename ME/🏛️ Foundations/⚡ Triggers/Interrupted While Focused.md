## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
Frustration, dysregulation, and sometimes disproportionate anger. It can create a jolt of cognitive whiplash — an involuntary loss of flow, focus, and internal control.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This often traces back to environments where focus was a form of emotional protection or productivity was tied to worth. Interruptions can symbolize disrespect, intrusion, or lack of safety.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Breathe and pause to re-anchor. Name what was interrupted internally: “I was in something deep.” Consider setting boundaries around work/focus time and affirming that it’s okay to return to your rhythm without guilt.
