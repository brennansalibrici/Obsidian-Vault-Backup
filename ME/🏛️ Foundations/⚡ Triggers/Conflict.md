## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
A surge of dysregulation — fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. You might feel flushed, tight-chested, hyper-focused on escape, or desperate to explain yourself. Conflict can feel like an existential threat, especially if you associate disagreement with the loss of love or emotional punishment.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
This trigger often forms in families where conflict was chaotic, explosive, or silenced entirely. If you witnessed aggression or were punished for speaking up, your system may code conflict as inherently unsafe — regardless of the current reality. It’s not just disagreement; it’s potential emotional annihilation.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Start by slowing your breath. Remind yourself: “Conflict doesn’t mean abandonment.” Anchor to your body and give yourself space before reacting. Practice viewing conflict as a doorway to clarity or repair — not a battlefield to survive. Over time, conflict can become a place of truth, not trauma.
