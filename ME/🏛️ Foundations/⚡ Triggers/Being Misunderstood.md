## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
This trigger stirs a sharp mix of shame, frustration, and grief. It can feel like being erased or misrepresented — like your truth is invisible or distorted. It often leads to either protest (overexplaining, defensiveness) or withdrawal (shutting down, dissociation). Internally, it can reactivate the belief: “I’m too much” or “I’ll never be seen clearly.”

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Being misunderstood is often tied to attachment wounds where emotional attunement was lacking. If you were frequently told you were “wrong” about your feelings or intentions, or if your inner world was misread and dismissed, this experience becomes intolerable. It echoes back to a time when misunderstanding = disconnection or danger.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Slow down and ground. Affirm your internal truth: “I know who I am, even if I’m not being seen right now.” Notice the urge to correct or collapse — and pause. Sometimes, naming the rupture directly (“I feel misunderstood”) creates space for reconnection. Other times, it’s an invitation to self-attune before re-engaging.
