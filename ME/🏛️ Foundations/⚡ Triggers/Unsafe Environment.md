## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
You may feel anxious, watchful, tense, or hyperaware. It may be hard to explain *why* it feels unsafe — your body just *knows*. The sense of danger feels ambient or ambient but real.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often tied to unpredictable or chaotic early environments where you had to scan for safety cues constantly. New, overstimulating, or sensory-discordant places can trigger the same body-level alarm.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Remind yourself what you *do* know about the space. Orient to exits, friendly faces, or familiar items. Move if needed. Later, explore what the environment resembled — and how to anchor in the present.
