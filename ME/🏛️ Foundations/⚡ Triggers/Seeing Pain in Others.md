## ⚡ What This Trigger Activates
---
An instinctive emotional surge — sadness, urgency, guilt, or overwhelm. You may feel suddenly responsible, flooded with feeling, or haunted by what you can’t solve.

## 🔍 Where It Comes From
---
Often rooted in environments where others’ emotions were intense, contagious, or tied to your safety. If you had to become a caretaker early on, pain in others registers as a cue to drop yourself and serve them.

## 🧭 How to Work With It
---
Acknowledge what’s happening: “This is empathy — and I still have a self.” Ground before you engage. Remind yourself that compassion doesn’t always mean action — presence is sometimes enough.
