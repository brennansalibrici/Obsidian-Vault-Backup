## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re not allowed to fall apart.”  
“Be strong — always.”  
“Fragility is weakness.”

It demands endurance even when you’re collapsing.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
Often formed in survival-based childhoods, this voice believes that falling apart = destruction. It fears that your whole world will come undone if you soften.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “Being fragile doesn’t mean I’m failing.” Begin letting others hold you in small moments — cracks don’t always become craters.
