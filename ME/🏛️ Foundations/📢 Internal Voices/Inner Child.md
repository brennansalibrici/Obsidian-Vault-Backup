## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Do you still love me?”  
“I didn’t mean to mess it up.”  
“Please don’t go.”  
This voice is tender, vulnerable, and full of longing. It often sounds young — because it is. It speaks in a way that reveals emotional truth without shame.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
The Inner Child holds the unmet needs, fears, and desires of your earliest self. It formed before logic — and remains beneath all adult strategies. When this voice surfaces, it’s not manipulation. It’s a need for comfort, validation, and secure love.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Meet it like a child. With softness, presence, and no need to fix. Say, “I see you. I’m not going anywhere.” Let this voice feel held. The healing isn’t in the explanation — it’s in the emotional attunement.
