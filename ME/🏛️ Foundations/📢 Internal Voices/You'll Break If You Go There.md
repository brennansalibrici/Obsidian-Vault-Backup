## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Don’t open that box.”  
“You won’t come back from it.”  
“Stay away from the deep stuff.”

It believes emotion = disintegration.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice was likely born during overwhelming moments of grief, trauma, or emotional collapse — when it truly felt like breaking *was* the end.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Whisper back: “I can go there… gently.” Let regulated processing begin to rewire the fear. Show this voice it’s possible to *feel* without fragmenting.
