## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Be good and you’ll be loved.”  
“Don’t mess it up.”  
“Warmth is a reward — not a right.”

It turns kindness into a transaction.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice grows from relational dynamics where love and warmth were conditional — tied to behavior, mood, or emotional compliance.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “Warmth is not something I have to earn — it’s something I deserve.” Begin noticing who offers warmth freely… and where you can receive it without proving.
