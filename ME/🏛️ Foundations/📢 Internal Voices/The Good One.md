## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Don’t make it worse.”  
“Be the good one — that’s how you stay safe.”  
“Just smile and go along.”  
This voice is tight and careful, speaking from a moral script. It equates goodness with safety, compliance with love.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often arises in families or cultures where dissent was punished, conflict was dangerous, or love was given based on obedience. It protected you by shaping you into what others wanted — even at the cost of authenticity.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Acknowledge its purpose: “You kept me safe.” Then gently let it know: “Goodness isn’t the same as self-erasure.” Invite it to help guide *values*, not suppress truth. It can still belong — but not in charge.
