## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“What’s the point?”  
“It’s not going to matter.”  
“You’ve already tried everything.”

It offers surrender not from peace — but from depletion.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often forms when repeated efforts have gone unnoticed or unrewarded. It preempts disappointment by lowering all expectations to zero.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Meet this voice with pacing, not pushing. Ask: “What might a *small* shift look like?” Let action feel possible again — but never forced.
