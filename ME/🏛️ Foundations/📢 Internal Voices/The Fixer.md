## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Just fix it.”  
“Do something now.”  
“It’s on you to make this right.”

It believes everything is your responsibility — especially other people’s pain.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice formed in chaotic environments where taking control was the only way to feel safe. It learned to manage feelings by solving problems, fast.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “I can pause here.” Let stillness be safe. Remind this voice that fixing is not the same as healing — and not everything is yours to carry.
