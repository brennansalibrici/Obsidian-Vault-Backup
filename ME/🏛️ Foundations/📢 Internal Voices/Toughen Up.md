## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Don’t be weak.”  
“No one’s coming to save you.”  
“Suck it up.”

It shames softness as a threat.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice likely formed in environments where vulnerability meant being ignored, mocked, or used. It protects you through coldness — so no one gets too close.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say inwardly: “Strength can include softness.” Let yourself be strong *and* tender — you are allowed both.
