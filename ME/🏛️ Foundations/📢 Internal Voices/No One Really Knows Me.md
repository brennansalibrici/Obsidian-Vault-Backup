## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“They wouldn’t get it.”  
“Nobody sees the real me.”  
“I’m invisible here.”

It aches for contact, but expects none.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often comes from deep loneliness or childhood invisibility. It formed when your inner world went unseen for too long and now expects disconnection as default.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say inwardly: “You are seen now.” Invite gentle connection — even just eye contact or one sentence of truth — as an act of courage against the wound.
