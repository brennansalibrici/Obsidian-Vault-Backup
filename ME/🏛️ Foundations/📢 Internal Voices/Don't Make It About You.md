## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“This isn’t about you.”  
“You’re so self-centered.”  
“Not everything is yours to feel.”

It shuts down your pain with a moral slap.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often develops in environments where others’ pain always took precedence. It acts as an internal scolding to prevent emotional “selfishness.”

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Remind yourself: “I can have an experience even when others do too.” Reclaim emotional space without needing to dominate it.
