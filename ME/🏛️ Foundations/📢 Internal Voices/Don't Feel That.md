## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re being dramatic.”  
“That’s not a big deal.”  
“Just move on.”

It mutes emotional truth and encourages bypassing pain.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often mimics emotionally unavailable caregivers or cultural messages that discourage vulnerability. It exists to avoid discomfort and keep emotional intensity at bay.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Name it gently: “That’s the voice that fears overwhelm.” Let yourself feel small pieces of the emotion. Begin building trust with your own emotional truth.
