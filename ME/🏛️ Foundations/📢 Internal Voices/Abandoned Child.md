## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“No one’s coming.”  
“Everyone leaves.”  
“I must not be worth staying for.”  
This voice often feels fragile, pleading, or grief-filled — desperate for connection and terrified of its absence.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice carries the pain of early emotional or physical abandonment. It developed when connection was severed without explanation or repair. It often emerges in moments of emotional distance, silence, or perceived rejection.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Offer reassurance, not solutions. Let the voice know: “I’m here. You’re not alone now.” Anchor in the present and use gentle tone. What this voice needs most is consistent, safe presence — not fixing.
