## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Something in us always ruins it.”  
“We’re too much.”  
“No one sticks around.”

It believes your connection always ends in collapse.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice was shaped by repeated rupture — where closeness turned to pain. It became safer to blame yourself than face the terror of randomness.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “Not all patterns are forever.” Name the growth. Let one new safe moment become a small interruption in the old storyline.
