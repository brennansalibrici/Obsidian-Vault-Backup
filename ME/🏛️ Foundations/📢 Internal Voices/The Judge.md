## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“They’re wrong. You’re right.”  
“They’ll hurt you — stay guarded.”  
“They don’t deserve your vulnerability.”  
This voice speaks with certainty, moral superiority, and underlying fear.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
Often formed in response to betrayal or misattunement, this voice tries to protect by dividing the world into “safe” and “dangerous,” “right” and “wrong.” It deflects pain by assigning blame — often to avoid grief.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Pause and ask: “What’s underneath this?” Often it’s hurt, fear, or longing. Offer compassion for the pain without feeding the righteousness. This voice softens when reminded that nuance is not danger — it’s freedom.
