## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re tired. Let’s slow down.”  
“You don’t have to earn love.”  
“You’re doing better than you think.”  
This voice is warm, soft, and calm — often faint at first, especially if it wasn’t modeled early.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
It may have emerged from therapy, safe relationships, or spiritual practices — or from your own earned reparenting. It grows when you practice presence instead of punishment.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Strengthen it by listening. Give it space to speak over the critic. Let it touch your nervous system, not just your thoughts. This voice restores what shame tried to erase: your worthiness.
