## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“This doesn’t matter.”  
“You’re wasting time.”  
“Other people are doing real things.”

It devalues your presence and purpose.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often forms in environments where only productivity or public recognition was affirmed. It turns self-worth into a scoreboard.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “My presence has meaning even when it's quiet.” Reconnect to values, not outcomes. Let purpose live in the *being*, not the proving.
