## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“They’re just pretending.”  
“Don’t be fooled.”  
“They’ll leave anyway.”

It discourages attachment by expecting betrayal.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
Born from past betrayals or emotional absences, this voice tries to protect you from new pain by expecting the worst in everyone.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “You’re trying to keep me safe — but I want to learn trust again.” Let relationships prove themselves over time, while watching your own patterns gently.
