## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“No one’s listening.”  
“You’ll just make it worse.”  
“Stay quiet — it won’t help.”

It convinces you that voicing yourself is either pointless or dangerous.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice is shaped by environments where speaking up was punished, ignored, or weaponized against you. It learned that silence = survival.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say gently: “I have a voice — and it matters.” Begin reclaiming your say in low-stakes ways. Let the muscle of expression rebuild slowly.
