## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re so selfish.”  
“Let other people have their moment.”  
“This isn’t your story.”

It accuses, even when you’re just hurting.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often echoes environments where your pain was seen as inconvenient or shameful. It’s trying to keep you invisible so you don’t risk rejection.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Remind yourself: “I matter here too.” Affirm your right to feel and speak — even if someone else is also hurting.
