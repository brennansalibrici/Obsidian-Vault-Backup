## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“It’s not that deep.”  
“You need to grow thicker skin.”  
“Everything hurts you.”

It ridicules sensitivity instead of revering it.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice may echo environments where emotional expression was overwhelming, inconvenient, or shamed. It teaches you to abandon yourself before others do.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “My sensitivity is not a flaw.” Begin honoring your noticing, your ache, your care — it’s not weakness. It’s signal.
