## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“What if I'm just being too sensitive?”  
“I probably misunderstood.”  
“Maybe it's nothing.”

It questions your reality and downplays valid instincts.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
Born from chronic invalidation or gaslighting, this voice seeks to avoid conflict by assuming the fault lies within. It whispers doubt to prevent shame.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Offer yourself this grounding phrase: “My feelings are real, even if I need more clarity.” You’re allowed to take up space in your own experience.
