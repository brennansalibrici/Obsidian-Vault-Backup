## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re not good enough.”  
“You should’ve known better.”  
“Everyone’s going to see how flawed you are.”  
It speaks with harshness, authority, and a tone of contempt masked as discipline.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice mimics caregivers, teachers, or cultural standards that taught you love was conditional. It believes shame creates growth. It’s often trying to prevent failure by preemptively punishing imperfection.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Don’t debate it — ground yourself first. Then respond with curiosity: “What are you afraid would happen if I stopped trying so hard?” This voice softens when you listen beneath its anger to the fear it's hiding.
