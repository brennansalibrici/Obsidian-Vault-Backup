## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“You’re irrelevant.”  
“No one would notice if you stopped showing up.”  
“You’re background noise.”

It erases your existence from the story.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice formed when others failed to reflect your worth — or only noticed you when you performed. It lives in the shadows of neglect and emotional silence.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Whisper this truth: “I matter, even when unseen.” Build visibility in gentle ways — journaling, sharing with one trusted person, letting someone know *you’re here*.
