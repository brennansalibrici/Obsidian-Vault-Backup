## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Observe. Don’t engage.”  
“Watch everyone before you speak.”  
“Stay still. It’s safer to witness than participate.”  
This voice is quiet, skeptical, and detached.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
Often formed in homes with volatility, performance expectations, or surveillance. The Watcher protects through emotional distancing and pattern recognition — always monitoring the room for threat or approval.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Thank it for noticing. Then ask gently: “What would it be like to *join*?” The Watcher softens when it learns that safety doesn’t require disappearance — only discernment.
