## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“No one could love someone like you.”  
“You’re too flawed.”  
“It’s not in you.”

It tries to explain rejection by declaring you unworthy of love.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice may have emerged after deep disconnection or loss, where your core was exposed and met with silence. It learned to pre-reject you before others could.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say softly: “Love is for me too.” Begin letting love in — not all at once, but in crumbs and presence. This voice needs warmth more than logic.
