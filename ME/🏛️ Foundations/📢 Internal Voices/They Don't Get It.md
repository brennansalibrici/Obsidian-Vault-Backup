## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Why even try?”  
“They won’t understand.”  
“It’s not worth the effort.”

It keeps you distant to avoid more disappointment.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often grows from repeated invalidation or being misunderstood. It protects you by cutting off the hope of being seen.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Gently challenge it: “Some people might not… but some will.” Let yourself risk a little clarity — not everything has to be received perfectly to be worth saying.
