## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Shut it down — this isn’t safe.”  
“Be strong. Don’t let them see you.”  
“This is going to hurt — so back off.”  
This voice speaks with authority, urgency, and often a bit of fear behind the bark. It sees threat in emotional exposure.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
The Protector shows up in moments of vulnerability. It formed in environments where weakness was punished or boundaries were constantly violated. It takes no risks because it remembers the costs.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Don’t exile it — thank it. Say: “I know you’re trying to protect me. Let’s slow down together.” You don’t need to force vulnerability — but you can lead this voice toward *wise risk*, not total retreat.
