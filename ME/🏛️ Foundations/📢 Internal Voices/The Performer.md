## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Keep smiling.”  
“Be impressive.”  
“They’ll only like the best version of you.”

It pushes you to earn love through success and presentation.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often forms when attention, affection, or praise were tied to performance — and not simply presence. It keeps you shiny to stay safe.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “I don’t need to perform to belong.” Practice letting imperfections be visible — and seeing who stays.
