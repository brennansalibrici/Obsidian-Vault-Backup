## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
Nothing — or nearly nothing.  
It pulls you into blankness: “Don’t feel. Don’t speak. Don’t exist too loudly.”  
It communicates through withdrawal, numbness, and emotional disappearance.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice formed as a way to survive emotional overwhelm or neglect. If you weren’t met, it stopped trying. If visibility meant danger, it vanished. It is dissociation in voice form.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Meet it in stillness. Don’t try to drag it into action. Instead, whisper: “You can come back. I’ll stay here with you.” Slowness, warmth, and somatic safety invite it to re-enter the room.
