## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Dial it down.”  
“People don’t like intensity.”  
“You always take up too much space.”

It tells you that your fullness makes you unwanted.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often grows in homes or relationships where emotional needs were overwhelming to others. You were labeled “too much” instead of your needs being too unmet.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “I deserve space in full volume.” Begin noticing who *welcomes* your fullness instead of shrinking it.
