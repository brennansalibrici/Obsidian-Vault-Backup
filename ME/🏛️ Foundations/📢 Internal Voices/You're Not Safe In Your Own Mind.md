## 🗣️ What This Voice Says
---
“Don’t trust your thoughts.”  
“You’re unraveling.”  
“Your mind is the enemy.”

It warns you that your internal world isn’t a safe place to land.

## 🎭 Where It Comes From
---
This voice often emerges in anxiety spirals, dissociation, or trauma recovery. It’s the part that panics when your thoughts race beyond your control.

## 🧘‍♂️ How to Respond
---
Say: “My mind is loud, not unsafe.” Practice grounding — even naming objects in the room. Prove to this voice that your presence can hold the storm.
