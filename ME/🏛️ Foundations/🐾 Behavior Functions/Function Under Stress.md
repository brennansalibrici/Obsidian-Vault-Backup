## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Stays busy, organized, and in charge even when internally struggling. Performs strength and capability to avoid being seen as weak or unreliable.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Avoids feelings of helplessness or shame. Creates safety through control and external order. Reinforces self-worth by showing up under pressure.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks vulnerability, suppresses internal needs, and disconnects the person from rest or support. Eventually leads to burnout, collapse, or resentment.
