## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Approval-seeking smooths tension and secures connection. It adapts quickly to others’ expectations to keep peace and feel worthy. When attachment was conditional, approval became the currency of belonging.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It protects against rejection and shame. If love felt earned — through behavior, performance, or helpfulness — approval-seeking is how your system tries to avoid loss.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
You may be liked but not known. In chasing approval, you silence your edges, your limits, your truth. This leaves others feeling connected to your image, not your heart.
