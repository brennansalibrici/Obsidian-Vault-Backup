## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Masks emotion, avoids sharing struggles, or builds protective personas to keep others from getting too close.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Avoids shame, embarrassment, or being “too much.” Creates safety by controlling what others can see or access.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks intimacy, connection, and emotional support. Keeps people locked out even when safety is available.
