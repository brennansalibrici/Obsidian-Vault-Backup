## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Uses avoidance, numbing, logic, blame, or escape to dampen inner pain. It says, “This hurts — I have to make it stop somehow.”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Attempts to preserve functioning and avoid collapse. Also helps regulate shame or grief when there’s no safe place for expression.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Chronic avoidance of pain leads to disconnection, emotional bypassing, or surface-level coping. Healing becomes harder when pain is never fully faced.
