## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Maintaining control helps you create structure and predictability when life feels chaotic or uncertain. It gives the nervous system something to hold onto — especially when trust or safety were unreliable in early relationships or environments.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It tries to prevent emotional overwhelm, loss of power, or retraumatization. When you're in control, you don’t have to feel at the mercy of others, the unknown, or yourself.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
This strategy becomes rigid. It can block intimacy, vulnerability, or growth. Others may feel managed or pushed away, and you may never get to feel truly supported — because surrender feels unsafe.
