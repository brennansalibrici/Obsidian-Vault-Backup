  Shame is often the most unbearable emotion—this function drives self-masking, over-explaining, denial, or performance.

## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
This strategy protects your core self from being seen as bad, broken, or wrong. It reduces shame by deflecting, performing, fixing, or disappearing — anything to avoid the unbearable feeling of “I’m not enough.”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It tries to protect you from emotional exposure — especially when mistakes, feelings, or needs were met with ridicule or rejection. It’s a way of staying in control of how you’re perceived.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
You lose the chance to receive compassion. In trying to manage how others see you, you block the possibility that someone could see your shame and still stay.
