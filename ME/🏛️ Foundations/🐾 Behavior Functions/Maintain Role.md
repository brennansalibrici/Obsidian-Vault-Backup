## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Stays in a defined identity or interpersonal role, even when it no longer serves. May overfunction, suppress needs, or avoid change to uphold the role.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Maintains emotional safety and relational predictability. Prevents rejection, shame, or chaos by avoiding disruption of the status quo.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks authenticity and growth. The person may feel trapped or resentful, but fear losing love, stability, or self-worth if they step outside the role.
