## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Keeps emotional content at arm’s length through intellectualizing, minimizing, joking, or distraction. Allows the person to avoid emotional activation or collapse.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Attempts to stay in control, avoid vulnerability, and prevent reactivation of emotional pain.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Prevents connection to self and others. Emotional avoidance leads to numbness, blocked intimacy, and chronic inner disconnection.
