## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Suppresses emotion, deflects conflict, or takes on the fixer role to keep others regulated. “If everyone’s okay, I can breathe.”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Attempts to preserve safety and connection by avoiding rupture. It helps prevent escalation or emotional backlash from others.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Authenticity and emotional truth are sacrificed. The person may become resentful, invisible, or disconnected from their own needs.
