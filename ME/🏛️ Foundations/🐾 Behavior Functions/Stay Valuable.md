## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Overfunctions, gives, fixes, or stays upbeat to prove worth. Reinforces identity as helpful, capable, or morally good — even when depleted.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Protects against rejection, invisibility, or unworthiness. Helps maintain relational safety by being needed or admired.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Self-worth becomes conditional. People struggle to rest, say no, or express need. Relationships may become transactional or imbalanced.
