## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Emotionally “blows a fuse” to get rid of inner pressure — yelling, crying, pacing, throwing something, venting. It lets the body metabolize what words cannot yet express.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Attempts to reduce inner intensity that feels unbearable to hold. It may also signal a protest — “This hurts and I’m alone in it.”

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Can damage relationships if it’s uncontrolled or weaponized. Often misread as aggression or manipulation, even when it’s a dysregulated form of protest or release.
