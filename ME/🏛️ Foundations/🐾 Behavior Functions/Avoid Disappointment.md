## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Suppresses desire, numbs hope, or assumes the worst to avoid being let down. Avoids setting goals or expressing needs to sidestep potential pain.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Protects the heart from collapse when things don’t go as hoped. Keeps expectations low to stay emotionally safe.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Leads to emotional numbness, missed opportunities, and chronic dissatisfaction. Connection suffers when needs go unspoken.
