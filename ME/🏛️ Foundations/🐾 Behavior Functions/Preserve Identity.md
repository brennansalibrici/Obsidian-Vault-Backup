## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Holds tightly to self-definitions, roles, or identities that once brought safety or approval — even when they no longer fit. “If I’m not this, then who am I?”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Avoids disorientation, shame, or loss of relational belonging. Helps anchor self-worth in familiar, reinforced roles.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks growth, flexibility, and healing. Can cause internal tension when change feels threatening to identity.
