## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Undersells needs, avoids asking for help, or downplays hopes so they can’t be crushed. Stays emotionally guarded by assuming the worst.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Protects from emotional pain by numbing hope. Creates safety through detachment from desire or dependence.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks intimacy, authentic expression, and emotional fulfillment. People may feel undeserving, unseen, or perpetually stuck.
