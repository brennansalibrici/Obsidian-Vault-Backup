## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Hides inner world, downplays feelings, or avoids situations where flaws or mistakes could be seen. Creates protective invisibility.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Guards against humiliation, failure, or emotional punishment. Helps the person feel hidden enough to avoid triggering old shame.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Prevents connection, growth, and healing. The person stays stuck behind a mask, even in safe spaces, and intimacy suffers.
