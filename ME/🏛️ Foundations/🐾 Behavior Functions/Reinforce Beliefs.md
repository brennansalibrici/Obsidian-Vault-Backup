## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Replays old stories — even harmful ones — to maintain consistency in worldview and identity. It’s less about truth and more about survival: “If I expect this, I can brace for it.”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It prevents the destabilization that comes with cognitive dissonance. Especially strong when the alternative belief (e.g., “I am worthy”) feels emotionally threatening or foreign.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Blocks transformation, self-compassion, and secure attachment. Can lead to confirmation bias that keeps shame, mistrust, and fear alive.
