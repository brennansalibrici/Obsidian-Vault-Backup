## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
This behavior helps you maintain a consistent story about who you are — especially when you feel fragile inside. It polishes the parts that feel lovable and hides the ones that feel risky.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It tries to shield against shame, judgment, or emotional exile. If you were loved conditionally, self-image became armor — a curated version of “you” designed to stay safe.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
It creates disconnection. Others may love the mask but miss the real you. And inside, you may still feel unworthy — because only the polished parts get seen.
