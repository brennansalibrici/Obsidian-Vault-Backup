Pulls focus toward manageable actions, thoughts, or feelings. May include simplifying, isolating, numbing, or postponing what’s too much right now.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Avoids collapse or shutdown. Helps maintain just enough control to keep functioning or surviving the moment.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Chronic use of this pattern can shrink emotional tolerance, create rigid avoidance loops, or block healthy engagement with challenges.
