## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Prioritizes others' feelings, wants, or comfort — often at the cost of one’s own needs. Creates stability by becoming indispensable or non-threatening.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Reduces risk of rejection, abandonment, or guilt. Maintains connection through compliance and emotional labor.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Erodes self-trust, identity, and emotional fulfillment. Leads to burnout, resentment, and invisibility in relationships.
