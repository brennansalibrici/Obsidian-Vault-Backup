## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Hides behind roles, humor, withdrawal, or perfectionism. Stays just visible enough to function — but not enough to be truly known.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Prevents emotional wounding from being misunderstood, criticized, or too emotionally open.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Keeps people emotionally alone, even in relationships. Undermines authenticity, support, and real connection.
