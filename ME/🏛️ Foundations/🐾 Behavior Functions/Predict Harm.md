## 🧠 What This Behavior Does

Scans for threat, overthinks conversations, watches facial cues, or replays past experiences to prepare for the worst.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Helps create the illusion of safety by staying one step ahead of harm. Prevents emotional ambush or abandonment.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Creates anxiety, hypervigilance, and disconnection from the present. Can strain relationships or reinforce fear even in safe environments.
