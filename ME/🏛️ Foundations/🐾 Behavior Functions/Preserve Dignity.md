## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Maintains pride, self-respect, or emotional privacy when feeling threatened, ashamed, or exposed. May involve pulling away or shutting down to avoid appearing weak.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Defends against feelings of humiliation or inner collapse. Especially strong in people who were mocked, minimized, or shamed for expressing emotion.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Dignity becomes rigidity. It can prevent repair, block closeness, and stop people from reaching out when they’re hurting most.
