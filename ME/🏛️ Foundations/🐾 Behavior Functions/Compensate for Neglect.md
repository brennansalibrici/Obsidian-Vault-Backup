## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
This behavior steps in to fill the gaps others left behind — emotionally, physically, or relationally. It drives you to become the caretaker, the achiever, or the one who “has it all together.”

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
It tries to resolve the emptiness and hunger created by early emotional deprivation. If no one met your needs, you learn to meet everyone else’s instead — sometimes to prove you didn’t need much after all.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
It exhausts you. You pour out from a place of lack and may resent those who don’t notice. Meanwhile, your own unmet needs keep echoing louder beneath all the service.
