## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Organizes behavior to avoid threat, judgment, harm, or emotional overwhelm. This may look like avoiding risk, scanning for danger, or playing small to avoid becoming a target.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Acts as a defense against chaos or trauma triggers. It creates a sense of control in uncertain or dangerous environments.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Safety becomes over-prioritized at the expense of aliveness, connection, or authenticity. People may avoid growth, intimacy, or emotional presence.
