## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Works overtime to prove worth through achievement, self-sacrifice, performance, or perfection. It can also include defending against criticism or shame at all costs.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Attempts to prevent shame collapse, rejection, or feeling defective. Helps stabilize a fragile self-image formed around conditional love or approval.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
May lead to burnout, perfectionism, people-pleasing, or avoidance of vulnerability. Can make connection feel contingent on being impressive or useful.
