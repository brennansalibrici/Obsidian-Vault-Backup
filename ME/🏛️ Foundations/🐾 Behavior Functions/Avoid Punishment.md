Adapts behavior to avoid consequences, criticism, or discipline. May show up as appeasement, excessive self-correction, or fear of asserting needs.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve

Helps maintain peace and avoid conflict or backlash. Makes environments feel safer when unpredictability or punishment loomed large in early life.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way

People may lose touch with their true desires or authenticity. Can lead to internalized shame, chronic anxiety, and difficulty holding boundaries.
