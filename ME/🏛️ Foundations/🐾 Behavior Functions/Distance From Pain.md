## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
It buffers against emotional pain by numbing, intellectualizing, distracting, or pushing difficult feelings away. It protects the inner world by refusing to re-enter dangerous terrain.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Often developed when emotional pain was too overwhelming to feel — especially in childhood environments where comfort wasn’t available. It creates inner distance as protection.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
It can lead to disconnection from self, others, and aliveness. Overuse may block grief, healing, and intimacy. What once protected becomes a wall that won’t let in light either.
