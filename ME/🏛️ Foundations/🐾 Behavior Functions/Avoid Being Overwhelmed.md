## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Acts as an internal override switch — shutting down, distracting, or avoiding stimuli before it breaches tolerance. It limits exposure to emotional, sensory, or relational input that might become too much to handle.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
This behavior helps manage overstimulation, emotional flooding, or fear of collapse. Often rooted in early experiences of emotional chaos where no adult helped co-regulate.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Over time, this avoidance may prevent healing by limiting opportunities for expansion or learning tolerance. It may also create distance in relationships when vulnerability gets filtered out to preserve control.
