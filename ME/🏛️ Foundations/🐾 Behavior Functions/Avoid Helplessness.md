## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Avoids admitting how bad something feels — clings to false optimism, overfocuses on solutions, or numbs out to stay above water.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
Guards against giving up or falling into despair. Especially useful when a sense of helplessness once felt dangerous or overwhelming.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Hope becomes denial. It blocks grieving, emotional honesty, or acknowledging what’s real. Can leave others feeling dismissed or emotionally disconnected.
