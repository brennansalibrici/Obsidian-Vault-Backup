## 🧠 What This Behavior Does
---
Seeks to regulate the external world so the internal world doesn’t spiral. Creating order becomes a strategy to avoid surprise, loss of control, or emotional threat.

## 🔁 What It Tries to Solve
---
This behavior tries to reduce chaos, sudden emotional shifts, and the fear that something unexpected will trigger pain or danger.

## 🚧 When It Gets in the Way
---
Can become rigid or compulsive. People may feel safe only when things are highly controlled, making relationships feel suffocating or emotionally scripted.
