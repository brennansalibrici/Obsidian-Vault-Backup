## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff balances the drive to produce, accomplish, and stay in motion with the quieter need to feel and integrate your inner world.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If you were only praised when achieving or busy, you may have equated productivity with worth. Feeling became a liability — a threat to momentum.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It begins to shift when wholeness, not hustle, becomes the measure of success. You learn that stillness is not failure — it’s access to truth.
