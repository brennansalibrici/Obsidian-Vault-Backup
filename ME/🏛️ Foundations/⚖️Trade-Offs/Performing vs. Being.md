## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff captures the pressure to maintain an idealized version of yourself in order to be accepted — instead of being your real, human self.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If attention, praise, or affection only came when you achieved or pleased, performance became your identity. You lost touch with simply being.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It softens when your worth is no longer measured by performance. You reclaim your right to exist, rest, and be known — even when you’re not “on.”
