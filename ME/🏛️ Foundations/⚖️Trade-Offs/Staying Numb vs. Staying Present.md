## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the tension between emotional suppression and emotional presence — the pull to remain numb and detached versus the longing to feel, connect, and be fully alive.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
Numbing often arises from past experiences where feeling deeply was unsafe, overwhelming, or met with judgment. It protected you when your system couldn't handle the weight of emotion — but also blocked access to healing and connection.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The system begins to heal when feeling is approached with gentleness and pacing. Safety must be rebuilt inside the body before presence feels possible. Over time, emotional capacity grows — not all at once, but breath by breath.
