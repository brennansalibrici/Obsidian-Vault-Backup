## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff surfaces when your worth is tied to effort or productivity — as though rest or presence is never quite enough.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
You may have learned early that love or safety came through action. Stillness wasn’t safe — being was never the goal, only doing.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It begins with allowing presence to matter. You learn to anchor into your being, not your output.
