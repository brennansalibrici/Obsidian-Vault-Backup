## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff shows the tension between preserving peace and asserting power — especially when your voice has been costly.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
You may have learned that standing your ground led to pain — so yielding became your shield. But it also left you powerless.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It softens as you practice strength with care. You learn to speak clearly, not to dominate — but to remain whole.
