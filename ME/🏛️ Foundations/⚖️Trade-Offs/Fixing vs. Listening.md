## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff shows up when the urge to fix someone’s pain overrides your capacity to just witness it.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
You may have learned that love equals solving, not sitting. Fixing became your language of care — and a way to avoid your own discomfort.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It begins with trusting that presence is powerful. You don’t have to solve pain to share it.
