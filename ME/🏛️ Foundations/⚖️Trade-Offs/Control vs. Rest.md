## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff sits between the need to keep it all together and the longing to exhale, soften, and rest.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When chaos or neglect shaped your early world, control became the path to safety. Rest felt like weakness — or danger.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
You begin to trust rest when the world doesn’t fall apart without you. Safety builds from within — not from gripping tightly.
