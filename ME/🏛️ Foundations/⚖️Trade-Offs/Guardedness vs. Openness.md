## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff holds the tension between guarding your heart and allowing true relational openness. It represents a deep need for emotional protection competing with the longing for connection.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When openness led to betrayal, mockery, or manipulation, guarding became necessary. It allowed you to survive emotional exposure — even if it cost you real closeness.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
You begin to unwind this tradeoff by titrating openness — small risks, well-paced, in safe environments. Boundaried vulnerability lets you be known *without* being unprotected.
