## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the pull between maintaining peace and telling the truth — especially when the truth might disrupt harmony.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If truth was punished or exploded into conflict, silence became safety. Suppression became your peace treaty.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It loosens when safety and truth are no longer opposites. You learn to express with care — not aggression.
