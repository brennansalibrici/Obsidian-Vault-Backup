## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff lives in the tension between seeking comfort and escaping discomfort. It questions: is this soothing... or is it numbing?

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When emotional pain wasn’t safe to feel or express, numbing became the only tolerable form of self-regulation. You learned to calm yourself by disconnecting — not by being with what was true.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The split softens when soothing becomes conscious and compassionate rather than compulsive. You learn to regulate *with* the emotion rather than by shutting it down.
