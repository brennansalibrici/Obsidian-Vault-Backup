## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reveals the fear that being authentic will cost you belonging — so compliance feels safer than truth.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
You may have learned that disagreement or divergence led to withdrawal, punishment, or abandonment. So you complied — and disappeared.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This changes when truth doesn’t break connection. You learn to honor your voice *and* stay in relationship.
