## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the inner push and pull between the instinct to guard your heart and the desire to be emotionally open. It’s the classic inner war between protecting yourself from pain and risking connection through vulnerability.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If vulnerability in the past led to ridicule, betrayal, or abandonment, self-protection becomes the shield. It helps keep your tender parts safe, even when that safety comes at the cost of closeness.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
Healing happens when vulnerability meets safety. This tradeoff begins to shift when you experience moments of openness that don’t lead to harm. Practicing tiny disclosures and tracking safe responses rewires what exposure means.
