## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff captures the fear that connection requires you to disappear — to minimize yourself in order to stay accepted.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If being visible once triggered shame, abandonment, or punishment, self-erasure became protection. It was safer to fade than risk rejection.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This loosens when your wholeness is welcomed. You learn to stay visible, speak needs, and still be held — not pushed away.
