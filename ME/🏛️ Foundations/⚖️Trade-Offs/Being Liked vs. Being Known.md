## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the dilemma between maintaining a likable image and letting others truly see who you are — even the messy parts.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When love seemed conditional — based on performance, ease, or perfection — you learned to hide your realness for acceptance. Being liked became more important than being known.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This split softens when being known no longer threatens belonging. You take relational risks, speak from truth, and discover who’s actually safe enough to hold you.
