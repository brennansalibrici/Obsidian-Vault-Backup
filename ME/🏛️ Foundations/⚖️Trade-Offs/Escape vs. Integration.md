## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff holds the conflict between fleeing discomfort and embracing wholeness. It’s the desire to escape pain versus the deeper need to metabolize and make meaning from it.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If past overwhelm wasn’t survivable, your system learned to dissociate or distract. Escape wasn’t weakness — it was wisdom. But integration takes a different kind of strength.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The path forward involves staying with small pieces of discomfort — supported, grounded, and in choice. Integration asks you not to drown in your story, but to walk through it, fully awake.
