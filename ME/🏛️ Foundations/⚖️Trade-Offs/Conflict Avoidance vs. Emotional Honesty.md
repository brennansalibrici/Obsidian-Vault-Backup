## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff holds the tension between emotional honesty and the need to avoid relational volatility. It reflects the inner voice that fears truth will cost connection or safety.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When conflict led to chaos, punishment, or silence, avoiding it became survival. Naming emotions or realities felt too risky — especially when peace was fragile and easily broken.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This system loosens when truth-telling is modeled as safe, respectful, and mutual. Practicing relational honesty within containment builds trust, connection, and internal coherence.
