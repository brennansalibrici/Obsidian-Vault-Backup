## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the pull between mentally preparing for future threats and surrendering to the present moment.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If you were blindsided by pain or trauma, anticipating became your armor. Presence felt unsafe — too unpredictable.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It begins by creating safety in the body. You learn that now is not then — and this moment holds more than fear.
