## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff lives in the tension between stepping in and stepping back. Helping often masks the fear that allowing will lead to failure or abandonment.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If being needed gave you identity or safety, helping became your anchor. You learned to take care of others so no one would leave — or hurt.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It softens when you trust that others have their own path — and strength. Allowing becomes a form of faith, not failure.
