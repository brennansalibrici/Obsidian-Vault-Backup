## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the belief that acceptance is earned through compliance, rather than authenticity. It’s the confusion between being liked and being loved.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
When needs were met only if you stayed agreeable or selfless, pleasing became survival. Belonging meant performing — not being.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This begins to shift when you experience connection that survives disagreement. Real belonging honors boundaries — not just your silence.
