## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the urge to release emotional intensity through explosive discharge versus the vulnerability of letting someone help regulate your nervous system with you.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If your pain was ignored or punished, you learned the only relief came from eruption — not shared regulation. Co-regulation may now feel foreign or even dangerous.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This begins to shift when your system learns that pain can be felt *with* another — and soothed. Regulation becomes relational, not just reactive.
