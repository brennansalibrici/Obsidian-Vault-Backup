## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff lives in the moment where rising emotional heat meets the chance to stay grounded. It’s the tug between reacting fast and staying emotionally anchored.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If your needs were ignored until you raised your voice, then yelling became the only way to feel heard. Explosion became the proof that you mattered.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It shifts when you learn to speak clearly *before* the volcano blows. Presence becomes power. You learn to stay with the sensation — and still move the world with words.
