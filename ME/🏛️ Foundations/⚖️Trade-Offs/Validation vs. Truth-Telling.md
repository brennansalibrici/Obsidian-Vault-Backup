## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the tension between offering validation for others’ feelings and expressing your own truth when they conflict. It’s the instinct to preserve connection even when agreement feels false.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If disagreement was treated as betrayal, cruelty, or abandonment, you learned to swallow truth to preserve peace. This tradeoff forms when love seems to depend on affirmation — not authenticity.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
Healing begins when connection is no longer dependent on sameness. Boundaried truth-telling paired with empathy shows that both care and honesty can coexist.
