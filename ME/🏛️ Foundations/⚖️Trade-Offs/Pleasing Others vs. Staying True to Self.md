## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff captures the struggle between expressing your true self and maintaining approval, harmony, or connection with others. It’s the inner war between belonging and authenticity.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
Many people learn early that love is conditional — that approval must be earned by being helpful, agreeable, or low-maintenance. Over time, self-expression feels threatening because it risks disapproval or rejection.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The tradeoff loosens when you experience connection that holds your honesty. Healing comes from practicing truth-telling in safe relationships, grieving the false self you’ve had to perform, and reclaiming your right to take up space — as you are.
