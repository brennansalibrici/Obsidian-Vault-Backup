## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the conflict between holding onto familiar relational identities and stepping into fuller, messier, more authentic wholeness. It’s the fear of losing love when you stop playing the expected part.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If love was given for performing well, being strong, or being helpful, then the role became your identity. It made you feel safe and needed — but at the cost of your full self.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The system starts to shift when relationships honor the *whole* of you — not just the part that serves others. Healing comes by grieving what the role cost you and choosing to grow anyway.
