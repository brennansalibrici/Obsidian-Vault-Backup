## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the split between maintaining external harmony and advocating for internal truth. You may keep the peace to preserve connection — but sacrifice your voice along the way.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If naming needs led to backlash, dismissal, or guilt, silence became safety. You learned that being “low maintenance” was the price of inclusion.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
This tradeoff eases when needs are welcomed, not punished. Healing comes through practicing honest expression in low-stakes settings, where safety builds the courage to advocate even in high-stakes ones.
