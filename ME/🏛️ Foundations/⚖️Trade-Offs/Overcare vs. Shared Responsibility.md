## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff captures the pressure to overextend for others versus allowing space for mutual responsibility.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
If your value came from being needed, overcare felt like love. But the cost was often resentment, depletion, and invisibility.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It softens when you experience care as shared. When you release control, others get to rise.
