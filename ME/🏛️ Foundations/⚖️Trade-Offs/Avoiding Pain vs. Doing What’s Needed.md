## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff captures the push-pull between emotional avoidance and necessary action. It’s the tug between fleeing discomfort and stepping into what’s painful *but true*.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
Pain once meant danger — or more than your system could hold. So avoidance became wisdom. But over time, the things you avoid grow heavier, and healing requires moving toward them.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
It begins when pain is reframed as meaningful, not fatal. Action guided by values — with pacing and support — creates internal safety for doing the hard thing.
