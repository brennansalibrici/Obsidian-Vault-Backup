## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff holds the tension between maintaining emotional control and allowing yourself to feel — especially when emotions are intense or long-repressed.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
You may have learned that emotional expression led to chaos or shame. So “holding it together” became the safest way to survive.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
Healing begins when your emotions can rise without swallowing you. You learn that feeling deeply doesn’t mean you’re falling apart — it means you’re alive.
