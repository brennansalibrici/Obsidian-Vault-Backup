## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the emotional tension between needing closeness to feel connected and needing independence to feel safe or real. It often emerges when emotional enmeshment or abandonment shaped early experiences.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
For some, closeness once meant losing autonomy, identity, or safety. For others, too much independence meant emotional starvation. This split forms a protective paradox: closeness threatens the self, while distance threatens the heart.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The system begins to soften when relationships allow for *both* presence and space. Integration happens through connection that respects individuality — and through internal permission to belong *without* vanishing.
