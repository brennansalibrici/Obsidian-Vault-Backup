## ⚖️ What’s Being Balanced
---
This tradeoff reflects the inner tension between choosing what’s familiar and stepping into what’s possible. It’s the pull between comfort and the transformation growth often demands.

## 🤔 Why This Tradeoff Exists
---
Comfort keeps you safe — especially when the unknown has felt threatening. Growth requires change, which may have once meant danger, instability, or loss. So the system clings to what it knows, even when it hurts.

## 🔓 How It Could Unwind
---
The system softens when growth is reframed as internal safety, not external risk. Gentle steps, emotional co-regulation, and belief in your capacity to adapt help growth feel survivable — and even desirable.
