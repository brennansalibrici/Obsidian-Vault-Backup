## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Gentle touch from a safe person — a hug, a hand on the back, holding hands — helps reorient you to connection and safety. It uses the body’s social engagement system to restore calm through physical presence.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Ideal when emotional overwhelm, loneliness, or disconnection shows up. Particularly helpful when you’ve been stuck in hypervigilance or feel frozen.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Touch that’s attuned, slow, and offered with consent activates oxytocin and calms the stress response. It sends a message: “You’re not alone. You’re safe enough now.” It restores what early neglect or relational rupture once stole.
