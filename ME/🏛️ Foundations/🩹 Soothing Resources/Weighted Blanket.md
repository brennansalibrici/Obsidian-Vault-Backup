## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Weighted blankets provide deep pressure stimulation, which signals safety to the nervous system. They ground the body and help restore calm after stress or emotional activation.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Use when anxious, unsettled, or unable to feel “held” emotionally. Especially helpful for sleep support, emotional containment, or transition times.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
The physical containment mirrors emotional containment. It says to your body, “You are surrounded. You’re not floating away.” It gently co-regulates through consistent, gentle pressure.
