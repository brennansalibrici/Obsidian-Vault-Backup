## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Safe assertion allows you to express your needs, limits, or truth without aggression or collapse. It returns your voice to you and reminds your system that you’re allowed to take up space.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
When you feel yourself shrinking, appeasing, or going quiet out of fear. It’s especially helpful after people-pleasing or moments when your truth was bypassed.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Assertion reclaims agency. It disrupts the pattern of emotional self-erasure and helps restore inner dignity. With practice, your nervous system learns: “I can speak and still be safe.”
