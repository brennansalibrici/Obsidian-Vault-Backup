## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Journaling clears the fog. It moves what’s swirling inside into structure — onto paper, out of your head. It helps transform emotional chaos into something you can see and hold.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
When your thoughts are tangled, your feelings are loud but unclear, or when you need to *witness* your own experience. Especially helpful when you feel like no one else is seeing you.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
By narrating your internal world, you begin to feel real to yourself. This increases coherence, emotional processing, and the ability to choose your next step with greater clarity.
