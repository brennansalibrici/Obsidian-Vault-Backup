## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Grounding breath returns you to the present moment. It creates a pause between stimulus and response. When practiced slowly and deliberately, it soothes racing thoughts and brings your awareness back into your body.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Any time you feel fragmented, reactive, or emotionally disoriented. Ideal for transitions, after triggering conversations, or when trying to regain internal footing.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
It activates the vagus nerve and slows down the fight-flight response. Conscious breathing offers the body a cue: “We are safe. We can stay.” This consistent anchoring deepens emotional regulation and self-trust.
