## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Comfort touch soothes the body through warm, nurturing contact — such as placing a hand on your chest, wrapping yourself in a blanket, or cradling your face. It invites your nervous system into safety by mimicking the kind of physical reassurance often missing in moments of distress.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Use this when you're feeling emotionally raw, a little lost, or when you notice self-judgment beginning to spike. It’s especially helpful when you’re alone and need to re-regulate without words.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
It works by calming the limbic system and offering a somatic signal of presence and care. Even small, deliberate touch — done slowly and with intention — helps your system shift from defense to grounded connection.
