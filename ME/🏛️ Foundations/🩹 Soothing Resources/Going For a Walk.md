## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Walking creates forward momentum in both body and mind. It calms the nervous system through bilateral stimulation and reconnects you with your surroundings in real-time.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
When you feel stuck, emotionally flat, or mentally spiraling. Especially useful when processing heavy thoughts or needing to reset after conflict or collapse.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Walking reduces cortisol, regulates breath, and facilitates emotional digestion. It creates enough movement to access clarity — without demanding performance or perfection.
