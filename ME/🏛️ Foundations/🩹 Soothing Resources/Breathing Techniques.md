## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Targeted breathing techniques — such as box breathing, 4-7-8 breath, or alternate nostril breathing — shift the body out of sympathetic arousal and into parasympathetic calm.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
When overwhelmed, anxious, or emotionally raw. Use during transitions, difficult conversations, or after triggering moments to come back to center.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Intentional breath interrupts panic patterns and restores agency. It provides a way to *do something* in the face of powerlessness — something that brings you back to your body and the moment.
