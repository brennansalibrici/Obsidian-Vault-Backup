## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Eye contact, when attuned and warm, creates emotional safety. It’s a powerful form of nonverbal co-regulation — reminding your system that it’s safe to be seen.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Use when you feel emotionally scattered, alone, or disconnected in relationship. It’s especially grounding during repair conversations or after relational rupture.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Attuned eye contact repairs emotional mirroring and helps shift from survival mode into relational presence. It restores a sense of “I exist, and I matter here.”
