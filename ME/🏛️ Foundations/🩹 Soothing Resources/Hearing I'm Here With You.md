## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
This phrase — when spoken with warmth and presence — disarms shame and soothes fear. It signals: “You don’t have to carry this alone. I see you.”

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
Use this when you’re overwhelmed, self-critical, or afraid you’re too much. Especially powerful during grief, flashbacks, or emotional collapse.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Being witnessed without judgment restores emotional safety. It interrupts the belief that pain must be hidden or earned to be held. It offers sacred companionship — without fixing, only presence.
