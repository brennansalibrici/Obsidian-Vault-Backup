## 🕊️ What This Resource Offers
---
Grief rituals give shape to sorrow and validate what has been lost. They create space to pause, honor, and let go — whether through candles, writing, photos, water, or other symbols. It allows emotional pain to be expressed, not silenced.

## 📍 When To Reach For It
---
When grief feels heavy, unprocessed, or culturally unacknowledged. Especially powerful after breakups, death, relational fracture, or internal identity shifts.

## 🔄 How It Supports Healing
---
Ritual grounds emotional expression in symbolic action, which helps regulate overwhelm and reestablish meaning. It invites the nervous system to move from helpless collapse to sacred surrender and soft reconnection.
