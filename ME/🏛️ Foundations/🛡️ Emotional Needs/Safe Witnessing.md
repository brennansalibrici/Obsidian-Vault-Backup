## ðŸŒ± What This Need Represents
---
Safe witnessing means having someone stay with you emotionally â€” not judge or fix, but simply *be there*. It lets your pain be real and your story be honored in full presence.

## ðŸ“Œ When It Gets Activated
---
When youâ€™re in pain but others withdraw, interrupt, or deflect. When emotional moments are skipped over or treated like problems to solve.

## ðŸ’¬ How It Speaks
---
"Just stay with me."  
"Please donâ€™t disappear now."  
"I donâ€™t need a solution â€” I need to be seen."
