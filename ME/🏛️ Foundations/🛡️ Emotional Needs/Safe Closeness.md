## ðŸŒ± What This Need Represents
---
Safe closeness means emotional intimacy that doesnâ€™t cost you safety. It allows you to get close without losing yourself, being hurt, or forced into roles that aren't yours.

## ðŸ“Œ When It Gets Activated
---
When connection feels dangerous, conditional, or unstable. When closeness brings old fears of rejection, engulfment, or enmeshment.

## ðŸ’¬ How It Speaks
---
"I want to be closeâ€¦ but I donâ€™t want to disappear."  
"Can I be loved without being controlled?"  
"I need to feel safe while being connected."
