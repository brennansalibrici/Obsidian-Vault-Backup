## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
This is the need to feel emotionally known — not just heard, but truly gotten. It’s the moment when someone sees not just your words, but what lives inside them.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
When you open up but are misunderstood, corrected, or dismissed. When someone sees only your behavior, not your heart behind it.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"That’s not what I meant."  
"I just want to be understood."  
"Can you please see what this is really about for me?"
