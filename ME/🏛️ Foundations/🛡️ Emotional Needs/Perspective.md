## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
Perspective is the right to hold your own lens on the world and your experiences. It means being allowed to think and feel your way through life — and to have that truth respected even when it differs.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
When others try to fix, reinterpret, or override your experience. When disagreement feels like erasure. When inner truth gets traded for belonging or peace.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Please don’t correct my truth."  
"Let me say how I see it."  
"My view matters, even if it’s not yours."
