## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound develops when your thoughts, feelings, or experiences were dismissed, minimized, or misrepresented. You were left feeling unknown — not because you didn’t speak, but because no one truly listened.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may overexplain, become hypersensitive to being misunderstood, or emotionally spiral when invalidated. You might fear that if others don’t get it, your reality doesn’t count.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Validation begins with internal witnessing — honoring your own experience before others do. Healing also happens when someone mirrors you accurately and says, “That makes sense. I see why it matters.”
