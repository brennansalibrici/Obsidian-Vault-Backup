## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
Protection is the primal need to feel safe from threat. It says, “someone has my back,” especially when you can’t defend yourself. It grounds the nervous system and enables vulnerability.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
In moments of perceived threat, chaos, or abandonment. When danger (real or emotional) seems close, or when protective figures go absent.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Am I safe right now?"  
"Please don’t leave me to fend for myself."  
"I need to know you’ve got me."
