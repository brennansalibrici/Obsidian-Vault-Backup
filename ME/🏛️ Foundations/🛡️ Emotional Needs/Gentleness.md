## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
Gentleness is the balm of emotional life. It says “you don’t have to brace right now.” It meets pain with kindness and offers warmth instead of criticism. This need gives permission to soften, feel, and be human.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
When you’re in pain but met with criticism, solutions, or stoicism. When emotional self-talk is harsh or invalidating. When your sensitivity is shamed or silenced.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Please be soft with me right now."  
"I’m hurting — I don’t need a lecture."  
"I need to feel held, not fixed."
