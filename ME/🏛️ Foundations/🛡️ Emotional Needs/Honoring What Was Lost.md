## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
This need helps process loss. It seeks to acknowledge what mattered, mark it with reverence, and integrate that story into your ongoing life.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
After relational rupture, death, lost identity, or major transitions. Especially when others minimize or bypass your pain, or push you to “move on” too quickly.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Don’t pretend it didn’t matter."  
"Let me grieve this."  
"Help me honor what this once meant to me."
