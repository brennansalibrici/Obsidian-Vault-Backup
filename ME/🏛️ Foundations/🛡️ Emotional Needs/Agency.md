## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
Agency is the power to choose and shape your own life. It reflects the vital sense that your actions matter, your voice can steer things, and you’re not just being carried by others’ decisions.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
When you feel overridden, sidelined, or pressured into passivity. When decisions are made for you or when you collapse into “whatever you want” as a protective stance.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Let me make a choice here."  
"I need to feel like I have a say."  
"I don’t want to disappear in this."
