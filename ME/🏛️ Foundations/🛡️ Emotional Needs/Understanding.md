## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
Understanding is more than being heard — it's being emotionally and cognitively received in your full experience. This need reflects the longing to feel seen beneath your words and known in your emotional truth.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
It rises when you're misunderstood, prematurely reassured, dismissed, or when others listen with judgment or filters rather than empathy.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"Please see where I’m coming from."  
"Don’t twist what I’m trying to say."  
"I just need to feel understood right now."
