## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound comes from environments where unpredictability, chaos, or danger were the norm — emotionally, physically, or relationally. Safety was never guaranteed, and your system never learned to rest.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may live on high alert, struggle to trust calm, or brace against intimacy. Even good things feel suspicious, as if peace itself can’t be trusted to last.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Safety is rebuilt slowly — through consistency, attunement, and nervous system regulation. It’s not just about external protection, but about teaching your body that *this moment* is different than back then.
