## ðŸŒ± What This Need Represents
---
Connection allows us to experience resonance with others. It is the felt sense that someone is emotionally with you, attuned to your experience.

## ðŸ“Œ When It Gets Activated
---
When you're emotionally alone in a moment of pain or celebration. When others are physically present but emotionally unavailable. When vulnerability is met with distance or deflection.

## ðŸ’¬ How It Speaks
---
"Do you feel this with me?"  
"Are you in this moment with me?"  
"Donâ€™t leave me alone in what I feel."
