## ðŸŒ± What This Need Represents
---
Meaning is the felt sense that your life holds weight. This need anchors your efforts in significance, giving your experiences coherence and emotional depth. It affirms that your presence, pain, and contribution are not in vain.

## ðŸ“Œ When It Gets Activated
---
This need surfaces during life transitions, identity crises, or when efforts feel invisible or unvalued. It's especially loud when inner voices whisper that youâ€™re just going through the motions.

## ðŸ’¬ How It Speaks
---
"Does any of this matter?"  
"Please tell me Iâ€™m not just wasting my life."  
"I need to feel that what I do has purpose."
