## 🩸 What This Wound Comes From
---
This wound forms when your sense of worth was tied to fitting in — when difference was punished, inclusion was conditional, or your true self had to be hidden to remain connected.

## 💥 How It Echoes in the Present
---
You may shape-shift to please others, fear rejection for being authentic, or experience a chronic ache of being “other.” Even in groups, you might feel like you’re always on the edge of exile.

## 🧪 What Healing Might Involve
---
Belonging is restored through spaces that welcome the real you — where inclusion doesn’t require performance. The work is not just to find those spaces, but to *believe* you deserve to take up space in them.
