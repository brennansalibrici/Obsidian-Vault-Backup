## ðŸŒ± What This Need Represents
---
Internal safety is the sense that your emotional world is not a threat. It allows you to feel, think, and reflect without becoming overwhelmed or fearing internal collapse.

## ðŸ“Œ When It Gets Activated
---
During emotional intensity, shame spirals, flashbacks, or when you're alone with feelings you were once punished or overwhelmed by.

## ðŸ’¬ How It Speaks
---
"Am I allowed to feel this?"  
"I need to know I wonâ€™t fall apart."  
"I want to feel at home in myself."
