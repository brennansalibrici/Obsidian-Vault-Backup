## 🌱 What This Need Represents
---
This need reflects the instinctive desire to guard those we care about — to shield them from pain, chaos, or harm. It often grows from love, empathy, and personal history with unmet protection.

## 📌 When It Gets Activated
---
When loved ones are threatened, struggling, or emotionally exposed. When old wounds of failing to protect someone resurface. When you feel powerless to prevent someone else’s pain.

## 💬 How It Speaks
---
"I need to know they’re okay."  
"I’d do anything to protect them."  
"It hurts more to watch them suffer than to suffer myself."
