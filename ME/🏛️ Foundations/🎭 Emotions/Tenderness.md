## 🧾 Definition
---
A gentle emotional openness that arises when something fragile, innocent, or deeply meaningful touches the heart.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Tenderness is the soft gaze of your heart — the warmth that rises when you witness something sacred, raw, or precious.
It’s not about fragility — it’s about reverence.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It appears in moments of connection, caregiving, or unexpected beauty.
It’s often triggered by vulnerability: a trembling voice, a trusting hand, or a reminder of your own softness.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Tenderness invites you to slow down and honor what’s in front of you.
It says: *this matters. handle with care.*
It teaches that love doesn’t always roar — sometimes, it whispers.
