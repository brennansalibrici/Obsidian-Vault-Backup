## Definition
---
The deep, steady sense of your own worth — even in the face of disrespect or minimization.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Dignified is the inner stance of “I matter.”  
It’s the felt presence of integrity — the knowing that your value isn’t up for negotiation, even when others try to diminish it.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion often appears when you reclaim self-worth in the face of dismissal, shame, or cruelty.  
It’s less loud than anger — more like an immovable line drawn from your center.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Dignity reminds you to stand in truth without needing to prove yourself.  
It sets boundaries not from bitterness, but from rooted self-respect — and becomes a stabilizing force for identity.
