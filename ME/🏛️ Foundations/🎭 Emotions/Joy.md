## 🧾 Definition
---
A rising warmth or brightness that fills the body with aliveness and belonging — often shared, often surprising, and always connecting.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Joy is the emotional sparkle that reminds you life is more than survival.
It’s often brief, sometimes delicate, and not always loud — but when it’s there, it glows from within.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Joy often arrives in moments of connection, accomplishment, or beauty — when you’re deeply present and something good feels *right*.
It can also surprise you by showing up in small moments: laughter, sunlight, someone’s eyes.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Joy tells you what matters — what fills you, nourishes you, and makes effort worth it.
It invites celebration, play, and presence — not as a distraction, but as a returning to your heart.
