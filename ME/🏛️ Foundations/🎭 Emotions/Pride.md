## 🧾 Definition
---
An expansive emotional state that affirms your worth, effort, or impact — often rooted in integrity, resilience, or care.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Pride is the warm glow that rises when you’ve done something aligned with your values — and it landed.
It’s not arrogance — it’s acknowledgment of your presence and your effort.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up after acts of courage, creation, care, or mastery — especially when witnessed or named.
It also arises in moments when you defy shame by standing tall in your truth.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Pride reminds you that you matter, and that what you bring has weight and meaning.
It invites ownership, not performance — and often reconnects you to dignity, direction, or purpose.
