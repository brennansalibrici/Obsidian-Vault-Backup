## 🧾 Definition
---
A state of disengagement or emotional detachment used to protect against pain, overwhelm, or powerlessness.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Indifference is the emotional handbrake — the moment you stop feeling to stop hurting.
It often appears cold or apathetic on the outside, but underneath it’s frequently guarding exhaustion, disappointment, or fear.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It can surface after repeated emotional letdowns or in high-stakes moments when care feels too risky.
It may also be learned as a defense against chaotic, rejecting, or overly intense relational environments.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Indifference tells you that something inside has checked out — often because care became unsafe.
It invites curiosity, not judgment: *what became too much to feel?*
Reconnection starts with safety, not forcing feeling back online.
