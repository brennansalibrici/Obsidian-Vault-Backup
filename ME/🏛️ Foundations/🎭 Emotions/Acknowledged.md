## Definition
---
The emotion that arises when your presence, voice, or experience is seen and registered by another.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Acknowledged is the steadying sense of “they see me” — not just visually, but emotionally.  
It affirms that you exist in someone else’s world, and that what you say or feel matters.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion appears when someone responds with attunement: a nod, a pause, a mirrored feeling, or direct validation.  
It often contrasts sharply with the pain of being ignored or dismissed.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Acknowledgment nurtures your sense of self.  
It helps regulate shame, encourages honesty, and rebuilds relational trust — especially in places where you once felt invisible.
