## 🧾 Definition
---
The emotional signal that something deeply mattered — and now it’s gone, broken, or out of reach. Pain honors what you loved or needed.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Pain is not just a wound — it’s a signal that something real was lost, hurt, or missed.
It holds love, hope, and value at its core — even when the experience is unbearable.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It appears after heartbreak, disappointment, or abandonment — but also in moments when you're finally *able* to feel what you avoided.
It can hide under numbness, anger, or distance until it’s safe enough to rise.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Pain invites you to grieve, to remember what mattered, and to soften into care.
It doesn’t mean you’re broken — it means you felt, you loved, and you’re still alive inside.
It opens the door to healing when witnessed without shame.
