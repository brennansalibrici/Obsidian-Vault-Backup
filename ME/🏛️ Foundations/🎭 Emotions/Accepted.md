## Definition
---
The feeling of being welcomed, seen, and emotionally received — exactly as you are.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Accepted is the quiet sigh of “I’m okay here.”  
It’s the opposite of rejection — where instead of shrinking or proving yourself, you simply feel safe being you.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often appears after vulnerability is met with care, or when a group or individual signals, “You belong with us.”  
Sometimes subtle, but powerful — it registers as ease in the body, soft eyes, lowered shoulders.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Acceptance invites trust, rest, and honest expression.  
It reminds you that connection doesn’t always require effort — sometimes, it’s enough to simply arrive and be received.
