## 🧾 Definition
---
A warm, activating emotion that arises when support, care, or hope helps you believe in your ability to move forward. It’s the emotional lift that says: you’re not alone, and this is worth trying.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Encouraged is the spark of light that shows up when someone else sees something in you—or when you finally start to see it yourself. It’s a subtle rising of hope and strength, a sense of “I might be able to do this” that restores direction when things feel uncertain. It’s often born in the small gestures of kindness or acknowledgment that breathe courage into our doubt.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion often arises after a kind word, a supportive presence, or the feeling of making progress toward something that matters. It may also appear after being reminded of your worth or capacity in moments of fatigue or fear. Encouragement thrives in relationships that offer belief and care without pressure.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Encouragement invites forward motion. It signals that you’re not alone, that you matter, and that the road ahead is meaningful—even if hard. It reorients you toward hope, effort, and growth, and helps restore confidence when it’s faltering.
