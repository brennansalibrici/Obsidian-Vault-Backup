## 🧾 Definition
---
A visceral feeling of being too open, too seen, or too emotionally naked — like your defenses dropped and now there’s no shield.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Exposed is the electric buzz of *this is too much* — when your inner world feels like it’s on display and you don’t know if you’ll be hurt.
It can feel raw, unfiltered, and dangerous, even in moments where no actual harm is happening.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up when you reveal vulnerability, make a confession, cry in front of someone, or are simply looked at too long in a moment that feels tender or unguarded.
It often traces back to moments of emotional intrusion, ridicule, or boundary violations — even subtle ones.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Exposed is a call for safety and containment.
It’s asking for protection, not rejection — for someone to stay close *without* pushing further in.
With the right kind of presence, it can become an invitation into trust instead of retreat.
