## 🧾 Definition
---
A soft, steady presence that turns toward suffering with care — offering warmth, not fixes, and honoring the humanity of pain.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Compassion is the open hand you extend — to yourself or someone else — when judgment would be easier.
It doesn't require agreement, only recognition: *this hurts, and that matters.*

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often arises in the presence of vulnerability, suffering, or sincere struggle — especially when you pause long enough to see beyond behavior into what’s underneath.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Compassion invites presence over performance.
It reminds you that healing isn’t always about solving — sometimes, it’s about *staying with.*
It softens shame, reconnects you to empathy, and often helps you meet the parts of yourself you once rejected.
