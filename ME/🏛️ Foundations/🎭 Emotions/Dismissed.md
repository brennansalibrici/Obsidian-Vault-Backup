## 🧾 Definition
---
The ache of feeling like your voice, presence, or experience doesn’t count — as if you’ve been erased while still in the room.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Dismissed is the sensation of becoming invisible — not because no one’s there, but because no one *takes you in.*
It’s the moment your contribution falls flat, your hurt gets waved off, or your words land without impact.
It can feel quiet on the outside and devastating on the inside.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up in relationships where emotional presence is low — when you risk sharing something meaningful and it’s met with indifference, minimization, or re-direction.
It also appears in childhood dynamics where your needs were too often set aside, ignored, or invalidated.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Dismissed reminds you how much it matters to be heard, felt, and acknowledged.
It asks you to name your longing for recognition without shame — and to seek spaces, people, and relationships where your presence is *actually* received.
It also invites repair when the dismissiveness was unintentional.
