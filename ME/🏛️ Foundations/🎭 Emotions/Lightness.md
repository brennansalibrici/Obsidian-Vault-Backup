## 🧾 Definition
---
A gentle emotional lifting — like breathing out tension and returning to a state of ease, openness, or spontaneous joy.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Lightness is the feeling of being unburdened, even if just for a moment.
It doesn’t mean everything is perfect — it means something heavy has shifted or been released.
It’s often quiet and internal, but deeply restoring.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It can emerge after crying, laughing, saying the truth, or letting go of a mask.
It also shows up when things suddenly feel less loaded — when presence returns.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Lightness reminds you that your system was holding more than it could carry.
It invites you into presence, breath, and play — and helps mark emotional release as meaningful, not trivial.
