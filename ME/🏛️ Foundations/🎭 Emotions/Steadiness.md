## 🧾 Definition
---
A deep inner rootedness that remains calm and capable even when pressure rises — the feeling of being your own anchor.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Steadiness is the solid ground beneath your feet — even when the world shakes.
It’s not flashy, but it’s powerful. It says *you’re still here,* even when things feel uncertain.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often arises after emotional regulation, clear choices, or internal alignment.
Sometimes it comes when you return to your breath, your body, or your values — and realize you haven’t abandoned yourself.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Steadiness reminds you that your center is available, even in chaos.
It asks you to trust your capacity — not because you have to fix everything, but because you don’t have to lose yourself to survive it.
