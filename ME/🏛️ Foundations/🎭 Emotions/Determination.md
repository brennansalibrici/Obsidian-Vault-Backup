## 🧾 Definition
---
A focused emotional drive that says, “I still care — and I’m not done yet.” It keeps you connected to purpose in the face of adversity.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Determination is the fire that stays lit when everything else goes dark.
It’s the inner grit that says, *This still matters. I’m not giving up.*
It holds the line between action and despair — not through force, but through meaning.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Determination arises when you’re challenged, doubted, or up against something that feels bigger than you.
It often comes after pain — not before it — and signals a choice to engage.
You’ll feel it when you take a deep breath and say, *I’m doing this anyway.*

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
This emotion guides you to reconnect with purpose.
It invites you to claim agency, even in small steps.
When determination is present, it means your values are online — and your heart is still in the game.
