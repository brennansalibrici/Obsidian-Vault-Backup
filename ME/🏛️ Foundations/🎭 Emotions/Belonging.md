## Definition
---
The emotional anchor that arises when you feel connected, included, and like you truly belong.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Belonging is more than proximity — it’s the felt sense that who you are is welcomed in the group.  
It answers a primal question: “Do I have a place here?” — and when the answer is yes, your nervous system softens.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often arises in moments of shared laughter, cultural resonance, or gestures of inclusion.  
Belonging can be loud or quiet — but it's always a signal of emotional safety in togetherness.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Belonging invites you to root into connection and to trust that you're not alone.  
It’s a stabilizing force that helps undo the ache of isolation and makes growth possible in community.
