## 🧾 Definition
---
A sharp, often sudden feeling of self-conscious discomfort when your actions, appearance, or inner self are perceived as unacceptable or exposed. It marks the moment you believe others are judging you—and you agree with them.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Embarrassment is like a flash of heat across the skin—a flood of "I want to disappear" energy. It's a moment of internal collapse in the face of imagined or actual social judgment. Underneath it lies a fear of being rejected for who you are, especially in moments you didn’t intend to be seen.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Embarrassment often arises in social situations where you feel you’ve done something awkward, exposed, or “wrong.” It can be triggered by public mistakes, moments of vulnerability, or being the focus of unexpected attention—especially when caught off guard. Even minor slip-ups can carry a heavy emotional weight when shame sensitivity is high.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Embarrassment signals a desire to preserve dignity and social belonging. While it can prompt self-awareness and correction, it also asks for compassion—for yourself and others. When you meet embarrassment with kindness instead of harshness, it can become a moment of gentle realignment rather than internal shame.
