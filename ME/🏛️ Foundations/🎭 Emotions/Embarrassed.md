## 🧾 Definition
---
A sharp self-conscious jolt that arises when you feel seen in a way that feels exposing, awkward, or unworthy — often in front of others.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Embarrassed is the hot flush of *please don’t look at me* — the inward collapse of being exposed in the wrong way.
It’s not always about doing something “wrong”; it’s about being seen in a way that doesn’t match how you want to be known.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It flares when you make a mistake in public, when attention lands unexpectedly, or when your vulnerability gets revealed in front of people who don’t feel emotionally safe.
It can also stem from childhood moments of mockery, scolding, or being called out in front of others.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Embarrassed reminds you of your longing for dignity and respect.
It invites you to breathe through the moment instead of shrinking — and to remember that being seen awkwardly isn’t the same as being unworthy.
Sometimes, humor or shared humanity can be a gentle way through.
