## Definition
---
The grounded emotional state of knowing who you are and moving from inner alignment.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Centered is the feeling of being internally organized — not scattered or pulled apart by outside pressure.  
It’s calm but not passive; strong but not forceful. It feels like “I know where I stand.”

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to arise after grounding, clear decision-making, or reconnecting with core values.  
Often felt in the body as upright posture, steady breath, and a quiet confidence.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Centered helps you move with clarity instead of reactivity.  
It’s the home base you return to when life throws you off — a reminder that your sense of self is still intact.
