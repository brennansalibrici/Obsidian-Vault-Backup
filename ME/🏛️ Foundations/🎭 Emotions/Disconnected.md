## üßæ Definition
---
The feeling of being emotionally cut off or removed from connection, whether physically present or not. It often signals a rupture in belonging and brings with it a painful sense of invisibility or not mattering.

## üíî What This Emotion Means
---
Disconnected feels like being on the outside looking in‚Äîeven when you're in the same room. It‚Äôs the emotional equivalent of radio silence. Like a dropped call with no redial, it leaves you unsure whether anyone even noticed the signal faded. It tells the nervous system: "You‚Äôre not safe. You‚Äôre not seen."

## üîç When It Shows Up
---
This emotion often arises in moments of social exclusion, neglect, or dismissal. It can show up when your attempts to connect are ignored, when you're misunderstood, or when you emotionally check out after too much stress, criticism, or overwhelm. It can also appear subtly after prolonged emotional distance, even in long-term relationships.

## üß≠ How It Guides
---
Disconnected signals a need to repair or restore connection. It invites you to check for ruptures in relationship or meaning. It asks you to name your own desire to be seen, heard, and valued. At its core, it calls you back into belonging‚Äînot just with others, but also with yourself.
