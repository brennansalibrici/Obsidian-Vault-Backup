## Definition
---
The relaxed clarity and inner quiet that arises when tension releases and the nervous system resets.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Calm is not the absence of emotion — it’s the felt sense that things are okay.  
It brings steadiness and allows space for reflection, presence, and ease.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion often arises after conflict resolution, emotional co-regulation, or physical grounding.  
You might notice deeper breaths, slower thoughts, or a sense of openness returning.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Calm helps you make decisions from clarity, not urgency.  
It reminds you to slow down, stay present, and return to internal safety when overwhelm takes over.
