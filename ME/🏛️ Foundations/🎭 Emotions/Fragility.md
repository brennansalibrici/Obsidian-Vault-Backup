## 🧾 Definition
---
A tender emotional state where you feel close to breaking — not from weakness, but from depletion or accumulated hurt.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Fragility is the sense that even a small thing might be too much.
It’s not drama — it’s the aftershock of carrying too much for too long without space to recover.
It often hides under a calm surface, showing up as quiet withdrawal, sudden tears, or overreaction to seemingly minor things.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to arise when your emotional reserves are low, especially after long periods of suppression, caregiving, or stress.
It can also appear in moments of intimacy, when you feel seen in your exhaustion and can’t hold it together anymore.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Fragility tells you it’s time to be held — by yourself or another.
It invites gentleness, slowing down, and turning toward the part of you that feels breakable without shame.
It’s not weakness — it’s the part of strength that asks to be supported.
