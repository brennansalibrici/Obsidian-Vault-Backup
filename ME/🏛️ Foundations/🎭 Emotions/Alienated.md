## Definition
---
The hollow ache of being emotionally or socially cut off — even in the presence of others.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Alienation is the sense that “I’m not part of this.”  
It’s different from solitude — this is disconnection *with a cost* to your sense of identity and safety.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often appears in group settings, strained relationships, or subtle exclusion — when the body feels absence more than presence.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Alienation points to a core human need: belonging.  
It invites you to name the distance, reach toward safe connection, and reaffirm your own worth *even when you feel like an outsider*.
