## 🧾 Definition
---
The aching experience of being left behind — emotionally or physically — often when connection was most needed.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Abandoned doesn’t just mean alone — it means **once counted on, now missing**.  
It carries the grief of broken trust and the helplessness of being left with no say.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion surfaces after abrupt disconnection, silence, or betrayal — especially in moments of emotional need.  
It can also appear even when someone leaves with no malice — what hurts is being left *at all*.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Abandonment reveals our deep need for connection and reliability.  
It asks us to name where trust was broken, and helps point toward healing through dependable, present relationships.
