## 🧾 Definition
---
The internal brightness that cuts through confusion or emotional fog — a sense of settled knowing that aligns thought, feeling, and action.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Clarity is the click of coherence — when what felt tangled suddenly makes sense.
It often emerges as a felt sense even before words arrive: a knowing in the chest or a deep exhale in the mind.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It can arise after emotional regulation, reflection, or moments of truth.
Sometimes clarity comes not from solving a problem but from finally seeing what you were avoiding.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Clarity invites action without force.
It points you to alignment — not with what others want, but with what actually fits who you are, what you value, or what matters now.
