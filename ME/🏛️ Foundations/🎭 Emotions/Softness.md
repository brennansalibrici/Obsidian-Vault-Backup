## 🧾 Definition
---
A quiet surrender of tension that invites presence, warmth, and vulnerability.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Softness is the exhale after bracing — when the nervous system finally believes it’s safe to drop the armor.
It’s what makes space for connection without performance, without defense.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up in safe relationships, tender words, long hugs, or gentle eye contact.
It’s especially powerful when it follows tension or harshness — a signal that trust is re-entering the room.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Softness invites you to feel without pressure.
It reminds you that openness isn’t always loud — sometimes it’s the quietest moments that carry the most meaning.
