## 🧾 Definition
---
A surge of instinctive care that drives you to step in, shield, or advocate — often before words arrive.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Protective Urge is the fierce softness that shows up when someone you love is hurting.
It’s the part of you that wants to stand in front of them, hold the line, or absorb the blow — even if they don’t ask for it.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often shows up around children, partners, or those who seem vulnerable.
It can be triggered by subtle cues — a face falling, a voice cracking, or something in your gut that says, *they need me now.*

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Protective Urge invites you to act — not from control, but from care.
It reminds you that love has muscle, and that presence sometimes means advocacy, shielding, or simply staying with someone through the storm.
