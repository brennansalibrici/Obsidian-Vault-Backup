## 🧾 Definition
---
A slow-burning anger that builds when needs, effort, or boundaries go unacknowledged — often masking deeper hurt or disempowerment.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Resentful is the internal protest of *this isn’t fair.*
It builds over time, often quietly, when you give too much, ask too little, or suppress your truth to keep peace.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to show up when you've swallowed needs, stifled anger, or carried more than your share without recognition or reciprocation.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Resentment invites you to name what matters before it leaks out sideways.
It signals a need to reset expectations, restore fairness, or reclaim your own limits and voice.
