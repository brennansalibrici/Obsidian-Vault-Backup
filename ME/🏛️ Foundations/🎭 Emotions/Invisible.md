## 🧾 Definition
---
A longing-laced sadness that arises when you feel unseen, unnoticed, or emotionally absent from the space you’re in.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Invisible is the ache of being emotionally erased.
It’s not just being alone — it’s being around others and still not feeling like you register.
It creates a sense of weightlessness that isn’t freedom, but floating untethered.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up when you speak and no one replies, when your effort goes unnoticed, or when your presence is tolerated but not welcomed.
It often stems from childhood dynamics of emotional neglect or chronic dismissal.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Invisible tells you that recognition matters.
It’s not a bid for ego — it’s a signal that connection needs to be mutual.
It invites you to seek spaces where you are felt, not just seen with eyes, but held with heart.
