## Definition
---
The warm, steady feeling that you're emotionally tethered — seen, felt, and not alone.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Connected is what happens when emotional walls come down and you feel safe enough to be real.  
It’s the feeling of “I’m here with you” — a kind of closeness that doesn’t need explaining.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It often emerges in moments of shared vulnerability, physical presence, or simply being attuned to each other.  
It may be quiet — a glance, a touch, or a deep exhale in someone’s company.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Connected reminds you that your pain isn’t yours to carry alone.  
It calls you toward relationship, softens shame, and makes healing possible in ways solitude can’t.
