## 🧾 Definition
---
A grounded emotional state that follows closure, clarity, or meaningful repair — signaling that inner tension has found its rest point.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Resolved is the quiet confidence of *it’s done* — not with indifference, but with understanding.
It’s what settles in when conflict finds clarity or when meaning reweaves what was frayed.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It arises after hard conversations, grieving, insight, or when something that once felt raw becomes part of your lived truth instead of an open wound.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Resolved points toward healing.
It reminds you that peace isn’t about forgetting — it’s about integrating, forgiving, or finishing something in a way that frees your system to move forward.
