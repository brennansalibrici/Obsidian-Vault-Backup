## Definition
---
The emotional pull toward another person that moves you to soothe, protect, or nurture.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Caring is the warm urge to show up for someone — not from duty or obligation, but from connection.  
It says: “You matter to me, and I want to help.”

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It arises in moments of vulnerability, pain, or shared connection.  
Sometimes tender and still, sometimes active and energized — but always grounded in presence.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Caring invites you toward the needs of others — not to lose yourself, but to bring kindness forward.  
It strengthens relationships, repairs hurt, and reminds you that love is often a verb.
