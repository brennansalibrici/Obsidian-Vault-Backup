## 🧾 Definition
---
The emotional fading that follows disappointment, where hope slips and the will to keep going softens.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Disheartened is the slow leak of inner energy when things feel like they’ll never change.
It’s what settles in after too many letdowns — a sigh beneath the surface that whispers, *maybe this isn’t worth it anymore.*

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to arise after effort is met with silence, rejection, or failure.
Sometimes it shows up not in loud breakdowns, but in subtle retreats: losing interest, not reaching out, or giving up on asking.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Disheartened invites you to pause and name what mattered.
It asks you to reconnect with support, meaning, and encouragement — not as motivation hype, but as reminders that you’re not alone and it still counts.
