## 🧾 Definition
---
A defensive emotion that elevates the self by diminishing others — often a shield for deeper pain.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Contempt is the emotional eye-roll that says *you’re not worth my respect.*
It often shows up when someone has caused hurt and you haven’t felt safe enough to express it vulnerably.
It can mask disappointment, sadness, or fear with superiority.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It arises in relational power struggles — especially when you’ve been hurt repeatedly and feel like softer emotions aren’t allowed.
Sarcasm, sneers, and dismissal are common signals of contempt surfacing.
It can feel righteous but leaves no room for repair.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Contempt signals broken trust or emotional saturation.
When noticed with honesty, it can point to where repair is needed or where you've stopped hoping.
It calls you to name the wound beneath the scorn — not to excuse harm, but to reclaim your own dignity.
