## 🧾 Definition
---
Grief is the emotional process of mourning a loss — whether it's a person, a relationship, a dream, or a version of yourself.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Grief is the ache of something deeply loved and now absent.
It’s not just sadness — it’s the hollow echo left behind by something that mattered.
Grief moves like a tide: sometimes roaring, sometimes still. It marks the space where connection used to live, asking us to witness what we lost and what we still carry.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Grief often shows up in the wake of endings: a death, a divorce, a dream that didn’t happen.
But it also arrives in subtle moments — old songs, familiar smells, an empty chair.
It can be triggered by transitions, goodbyes, anniversaries, or seeing someone move on while you still feel behind.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Grief invites presence, not escape.
It asks you to slow down and honor what mattered.
It teaches tenderness, connection, and humility.
When you let it move through you — not rush it, not numb it — grief becomes a sacred tether between past and future.
