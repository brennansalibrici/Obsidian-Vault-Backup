  The emotional response to losing something or someone deeply meaningful. Grief often surfaces when attachment is severed, either through death, disconnection, or the loss of what once was. It can feel like heaviness, yearning, or profound sorrow, and while painful, it also signals what deeply mattered.

## ## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Grief emerges when something once held close — a person, connection, role, or dream — is taken away or broken. It’s not just sadness; it’s the echo of love interrupted.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Grief often appears after major losses (death, divorce, betrayal), but also in subtle moments: when an emotional truth is spoken aloud, or when you finally realize something won’t be coming back. It can be delayed, stored in the body, or masked by anger or numbness.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Though painful, grief is deeply human. It invites you to slow down, to feel, to honor. It’s not something to “fix” — it’s something to move through. It reminds you what mattered. And in doing so, it gently reorients you toward what still does.
