## 🧾 Definition
---
A reflexive jolt of activation in response to sudden change or unexpected input — the body’s instant call for orientation and safety.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Startled is the body's red alert — not yet fear, but a wake-up surge.
It happens before your brain has a story, and it floods you with energy to decide what to do next.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up when something enters your awareness suddenly: a sound, a movement, an unexpected interaction.
If you’ve lived in a hypervigilant state, even minor shifts can produce a strong startle response.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Startled is your system saying *check the environment* — a scan, not a sentence.
It invites calming down, orienting, and deciding if the threat is real or past.
When respected, it resets quickly. When ignored, it can escalate into anxiety or shutdown.
