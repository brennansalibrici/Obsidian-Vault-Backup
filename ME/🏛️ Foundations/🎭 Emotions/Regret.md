## 🧾 Definition
---
A backward-facing emotional ache that arises when your actions conflict with your values, often pointing toward needed repair.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Regret is the pain of the missed chance — the choice not taken or the harm that wasn’t prevented.
It’s what remains when conscience wakes up after the moment has passed.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It appears when you reflect on moments where you let yourself or someone else down — even unintentionally.
It often accompanies growth, because you see what mattered *too late*.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Regret invites humility and responsibility, not self-punishment.
It asks what you’ve learned — and what you’re willing to do differently going forward.
When honored, it becomes a teacher and a compass.
