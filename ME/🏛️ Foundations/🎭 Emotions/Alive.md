## 🧾 Definition
---
The sense of being fully present, emotionally alive, and connected to something meaningful.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Alive is the electricity in your veins that says, *I’m here. I exist.*
It’s the sensation of being awake to the moment — heart beating, soul lit up, breath sharp with presence.
It’s the opposite of numbness. Even when it hurts, being alive means there’s something to feel.
It means you're not gone.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
This emotion tends to show up in moments of meaning — after grief clears, when beauty surprises you, when you speak your truth, or take a risk.
It can surge through music, touch, intimacy, or awe.
Often, it’s not the calm after the storm — it’s the first real breath *during* it.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Alive reminds you that your feelings matter.
That this life — even in pain — is worth inhabiting.
It invites you into truth, presence, and engagement.
It often marks a turning point: from shutdown to reentry, from surviving to choosing to live.
