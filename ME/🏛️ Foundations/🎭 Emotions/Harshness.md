## 🧾 Definition
---
A defensive emotional posture that uses sharpness or cruelty to push away vulnerability — often modeled behavior used for control or protection.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Harshness is the armor of emotional sharpness — it pushes others away before they can get close to what’s raw or wounded underneath.
It may look powerful, but it’s usually fear with its fists up.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to appear when someone feels out of control, shamed, or exposed.
If you grew up in a critical or perfectionistic environment, harshness may have been modeled as the only way to get respect — or avoid punishment.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Harshness tells you there’s a vulnerable part under threat.
It’s asking for containment, not escalation.
When you notice it rising, there’s often a younger voice inside that needs protection without needing to attack.
