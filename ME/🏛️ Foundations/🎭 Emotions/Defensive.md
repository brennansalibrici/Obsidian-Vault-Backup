## 🧾 Definition
---
A reactive shield against perceived threat, often triggered by shame, fear, or vulnerability.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Defensive is the bracing you feel when something hits too close.
It’s the instinct to protect, push back, or retreat — often before you even know why.
It can look like anger, logic, avoidance, or deflection.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up when someone questions your intentions, challenges your identity, or touches an old wound.
Even helpful feedback can trigger defensiveness if it lands on unhealed shame.
Sometimes, you may feel the need to prove you're good — even when no one said otherwise.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Defensive tells you something vulnerable is being poked.
Instead of fighting it, you can ask: *What am I afraid they’ll see?*
Meeting it with curiosity can transform it from armor into insight.
