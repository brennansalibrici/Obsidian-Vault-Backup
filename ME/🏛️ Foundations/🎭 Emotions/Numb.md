## 🧾 Definition
---
Numb is the body’s emotional off-switch — a shutdown response meant to protect against overwhelm, pain, or sensory overload.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Numb is the absence that hurts in a different way — the quiet freeze that says *feeling is not safe right now.*
It can be confused with apathy, but often it’s the result of trying to feel too much for too long.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
Numbness often arises after repeated trauma, overstimulation, or chronic disconnection.
It may appear during conflict, overstress, or grief — especially when your system decides that turning off is safer than breaking down.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Numbness asks for slow, gentle reentry.
It reminds you that your system is doing its best to protect you, even if the strategy now feels like a prison.
It invites compassionate pacing, sensory grounding, and trust that feeling will return when safety does.
