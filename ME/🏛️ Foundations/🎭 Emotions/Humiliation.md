## 🧾 Definition
---
An overwhelming sense of being reduced, degraded, or made small in front of others — often leaving a scar of unworthiness.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Humiliation is the emotional freefall when dignity is stripped in public.
It’s more than embarrassment — it’s the collapse of worth under the gaze of others, often paired with helplessness or rage.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to occur during public correction, mockery, betrayal, or coercion.
Even years later, a single humiliating event can echo and shape your relationship to shame, power, and identity.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Humiliation signals a profound need for repair and reconnection to self-worth.
It calls for dignity, restoration, and sometimes, protected space where your pain is seen without being judged.
It’s a wound that needs truth and empathy to loosen its grip.
