## 🧾 Definition
---
A state of emotional overload where your system is flooded beyond capacity — thoughts race, body surges, and everything feels too much.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Flooded is the tidal wave inside your body — when emotion hits faster than your capacity to process it.
It’s not just feeling “a lot”; it’s feeling *too much* all at once, with no time or space to sort it out.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It shows up in conflict, fast-paced conversations, or emotionally intense situations — especially when old wounds or high-stakes fears are involved.
Even “small” events can trigger flooding if your nervous system is already holding too much.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Flooded is your system’s way of saying *slow down.*
It’s not failure — it’s a sign that your mind and body need pause, breath, and containment.
It invites grounding, space, and co-regulation so the tide can recede and clarity can return.
