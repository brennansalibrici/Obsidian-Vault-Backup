## Definition
---
The jittery, uncomfortable energy that builds when the nervous system is overloaded or unsettled.

## 💔 What This Emotion Means
---
Agitation often feels like buzzing under the skin — a need to move, shift, or shake something off.  
It’s the body’s way of saying: too much, too fast, too chaotic.

## 🔍 When It Shows Up
---
It tends to arise when there’s a buildup of tension, clutter, noise, emotional pressure, or internal panic.  
Even small things can trigger it if the system’s already strained.

## 🧭 How It Guides
---
Agitated is a signal to pause and ground.  
It reminds you to discharge excess energy, take space, and tend to your overloaded body before it escalates further.
