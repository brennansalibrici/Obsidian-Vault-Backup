## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Comfortable in connection, but keeps emotional distance when space feels constrained. Strong sense of self, but quick to guard it when autonomy feels threatened.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
May seem emotionally steady, but pulls back when closeness gets intense or when partners express distress urgently. Can appear cool or guarded even when caring deeply.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Learn to stay emotionally open during others’ dysregulation. Practice soft boundaries that allow intimacy, not just protection. Let care flow both ways, even when messy.
