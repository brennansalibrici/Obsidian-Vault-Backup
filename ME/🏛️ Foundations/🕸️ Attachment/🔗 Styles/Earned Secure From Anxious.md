## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Functions securely most of the time, but carries remnants of old attachment wounds. When stress or distance hits, the nervous system may whisper, “What if I’m being abandoned again?”

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Appears stable and emotionally available, but occasionally seeks reassurance or becomes preoccupied with perceived disconnection. May be overly attuned to others' moods or reactions.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Build self-trust during silence. Allow reassurance without shame. Practice expressing emotion cleanly, without anticipating abandonment.
