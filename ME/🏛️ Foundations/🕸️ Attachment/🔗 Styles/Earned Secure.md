## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Earned secure individuals generally relate with steadiness, openness, and presence. But they’ve done the work to get there. Their nervous system may still carry old habits, but they know how to return to safety — internally and relationally.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Usually clear, kind, and grounded — but may experience flares of old patterns under stress (e.g. withdrawal, panic, over-giving). These don’t define the person but offer insight into their story and growth.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Recognize that security isn’t perfection — it’s repair. Honor your healing path. Let small regressions become invitations back to trust, rather than evidence of failure.
