## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This style appears self-sufficient or emotionally distant, but beneath the surface lives an anxious fear of being left or misunderstood. The outer shell is avoidant; the inner world is watchful, tense, and easily activated.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
May withdraw when intimacy increases, then feel panicked when the other person pulls back. Often intellectualizes feelings, minimizes needs, or reacts passive-aggressively when hurt.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Acknowledge the anxious part rather than hiding it. Practice honest self-disclosure without collapsing or defending. Learn that needs don’t make you needy — they make you human.
