## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Secure attachment reflects a balanced ability to stay connected without losing oneself. These individuals are generally comfortable with intimacy and independence. They trust that love doesn't require performance, and they recover from rupture through repair, not retreat.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Secure individuals can name their needs without shame, listen without defensiveness, and tolerate emotional discomfort in service of repair. They don't need constant reassurance, but they offer it freely. They approach conflict as an opportunity to connect, not as a threat to self.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Securely attached people still grow — particularly in deepening emotional nuance, supporting partners with different styles, and staying soft in moments of relational stress. Their edge is to lead with presence and humility rather than assume “rightness” from their security.
