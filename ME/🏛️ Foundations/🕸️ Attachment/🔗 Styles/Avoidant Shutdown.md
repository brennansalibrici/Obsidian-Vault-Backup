## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Emotion feels too much — so the system shuts down. Closeness feels threatening not because it’s bad, but because the body doesn’t know how to stay present in it. Numbness becomes survival.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Goes quiet during emotional conversations, avoids eye contact, may forget what was said during conflict. Feels safest in distance and disconnection. Others often feel rejected, even when the person inside feels nothing.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Don’t try to feel everything — just try to notice something. Begin with breath, body, and small moments of emotional name-it-don’t-change-it awareness. Reconnection begins gently, not all at once.
