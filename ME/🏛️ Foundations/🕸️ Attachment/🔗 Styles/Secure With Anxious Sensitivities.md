## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Relates securely with most people and situations, but emotional sensitivity may flare when connection feels shaky. Quickly aware of others’ emotional shifts and occasionally over-reads them.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
May apologize frequently, hesitate to share hard feelings, or seek reassurance under stress. Tends to over-accommodate or monitor tone when feeling emotionally vulnerable.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Trust that your presence doesn’t overwhelm. Let your emotional needs take up space without apology. Practice allowing discomfort in connection without assuming disapproval.
