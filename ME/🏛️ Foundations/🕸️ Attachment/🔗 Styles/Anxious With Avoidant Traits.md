## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Wants closeness and connection, but shame around emotional needs leads to distancing behaviors. The person may pursue a partner and then suddenly withdraw or numb out when overwhelmed.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Often hyperattuned to others, anxious about tone shifts or silence. May overfunction to maintain harmony — then disconnect when feeling unseen or emotionally unsafe. Apologizes often, but rarely shares their full truth.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Learn to trust that your feelings are valid and welcome. Practice self-expression before overwhelm hits. Build internal capacity to stay present even when connection feels uncertain.
