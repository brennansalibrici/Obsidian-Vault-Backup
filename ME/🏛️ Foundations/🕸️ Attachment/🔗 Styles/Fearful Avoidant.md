## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Fearful avoidant individuals are caught between opposing fears — of being too close and of being too far. They long for connection but expect it to hurt. Their inner world says: “I want to trust you… but I’m already bracing for the wound.”

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
They may idealize partners one moment and push them away the next. Emotional vulnerability often triggers panic or shutdown. There's a deep mistrust of both self and others — and a felt sense that intimacy will cost safety or control. Self-sabotage is common.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Healing starts with coherence: learning to recognize emotional whiplash and choosing a middle path. They benefit from slow, stable connection, trauma-informed support, and parts work that allows them to integrate both the pursuer and protector inside.
