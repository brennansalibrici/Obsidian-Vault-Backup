## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Relates with care and presence, but old patterns may pull toward silence or withdrawal when things feel emotionally intense. Shows up, but still feels the reflex to “go dark” when under pressure.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Often thoughtful, calm, and consistent — but may still retreat briefly when overwhelmed. May find emotional processing tiring, especially when required in real-time.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Practice staying relational during hard moments. Express needs even if they feel unclear or messy. Let others hold space for your emotional presence without fearing engulfment.
