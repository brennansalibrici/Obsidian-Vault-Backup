## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This style often wants closeness but fears being rejected, humiliated, or overwhelmed. There’s no single strategy for attachment — instead, there’s a panicked improvisation. Emotions feel unregulated, and the person can’t tell whether others will soothe or shame them.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
In relationships, this may look like emotional flooding, outbursts, or clinging followed by shame or retreat. Self-concept often collapses quickly under perceived rejection. Communication becomes frantic or confusing when emotional safety feels threatened.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
The path to healing involves building internal coherence: slowing down emotional responses, naming parts of self in conflict, and learning that emotion can be held rather than acted out. Trauma-informed therapy and gentle relational repair are vital.
