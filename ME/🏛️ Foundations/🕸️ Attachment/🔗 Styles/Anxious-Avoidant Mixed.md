## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This style toggles between reaching out and pulling away. One part fears rejection; another fears being overwhelmed. There’s no settled strategy, only a loop of longing and retreat.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Often clings in early connection, then detaches without explanation. May feel trapped in emotional intensity one moment and invisible the next. Conflict evokes deep confusion and emotional collapse.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Practice grounding both poles. Learn to pause when the urge to flee or chase arises. Let connection build slowly, with safety and permission to stay present.
