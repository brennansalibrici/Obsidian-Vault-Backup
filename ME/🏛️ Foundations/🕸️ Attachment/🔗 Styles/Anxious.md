## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This style craves closeness but fears it will disappear. Love feels fragile, and the internal belief is often: “If I’m not needed, I won’t be wanted.” Intimacy becomes a lifeline, not a choice.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Anxious-preoccupied individuals often seek constant reassurance, overexplain themselves, and may panic when responses feel delayed or unclear. Their nervous system is highly attuned to shifts in tone, silence, or space. Emotional intensity is often their way of asking: “Do I still matter to you?”

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
The healing path involves building internal safety and learning to regulate emotion without outsourcing security. They benefit from slowing down, naming needs directly, and trusting that they can hold connection even without constant confirmation.
