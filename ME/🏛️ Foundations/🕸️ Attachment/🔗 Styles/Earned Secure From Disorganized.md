## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Emotionally resilient and relationally available, but still carries echoes of old survival patterns. There’s strength in presence — but also vulnerability in emotional exposure.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Mostly stable and expressive, but may wobble in high-emotion moments or freeze when triggers resurface. Can name what's happening and repair quickly, but still needs grace during regressions.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Keep honoring your earned capacity without shaming the echoes. Trust that presence is more powerful than perfection. Let wholeness include the parts that once protected you.
