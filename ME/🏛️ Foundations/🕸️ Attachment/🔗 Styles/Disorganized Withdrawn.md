## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This pattern disconnects from emotion and others when stress hits. Emotional withdrawal isn’t punishment — it’s collapse. The nervous system says “go quiet,” even when the heart says “please see me.”

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Withdraws or shuts down completely during emotional moments. Partners may feel confused, abandoned, or punished — while the person themselves may feel overwhelmed and incapable of responding.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Learn to recognize early signs of collapse. Small steps into self-expression — even just naming “I feel shut down” — can break isolation. Healing happens through trust built slowly and quietly.
