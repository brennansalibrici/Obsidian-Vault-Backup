## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Love feels both necessary and intolerable. These individuals often chase emotional connection — then fear being consumed or exposed. Their inner world is divided, and no choice feels safe.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Alternates between overdependence and harsh emotional withdrawal. May idealize and devalue in rapid succession. Shame often follows vulnerability, leading to shutdown or blame.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Learn to name both parts: the one that longs and the one that flees. Compassionate parts work and relational consistency can help the system integrate and stabilize over time.
