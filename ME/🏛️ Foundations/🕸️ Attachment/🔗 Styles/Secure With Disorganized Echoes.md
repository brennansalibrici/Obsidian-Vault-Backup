  Internal voices may flare under stress, with moments of self-doubt or shutdown
relational_challenges: |
  May still swing briefly between emotional expression and withdrawal under emotional duress
partner_attunement: |
  Needs room to wobble without judgment — and consistent reassurance that repair is possible
definition: Relates securely, but occasionally touched by echoes of old chaos or fragmentation. Not a regression — just a whisper of what once was.

## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Mostly grounded, but still carries traces of old survival wiring. Connection is available, emotion is safe — but intense moments may still activate old protectors.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Brief shutdowns or overwhelm when emotionally triggered. May confuse partner by suddenly seeming different than their secure baseline. Often catches it quickly and initiates repair.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Let old echoes speak without defining you. You are not your pattern — but your capacity to respond differently is the proof of your healing.
