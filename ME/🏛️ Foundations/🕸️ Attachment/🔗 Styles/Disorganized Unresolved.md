## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
This style reflects an internal world without organization. There’s no predictable way of relating — only fragmented emotional memory, learned vigilance, and avoidance of exposure. Intimacy feels disorienting or unsafe.

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Disconnection, freezing, or flooding under stress. Partners may feel like they’re relating to different people depending on the day. Individuals may seem absent, avoidant, then emotionally intense — all in one interaction.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Stabilizing safety in the nervous system comes first. Gentle parts work, consistent relationship repair, and attuned therapy help re-integrate the self and reestablish emotional presence over time.
