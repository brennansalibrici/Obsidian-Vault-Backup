## 🧬 Core Relational Pattern
---
Emotion becomes overwhelming quickly. When connection feels threatened, the nervous system floods. The underlying belief is: “If I don’t fix this right now, I’ll be abandoned.”

## ⚙️ How It Shows Up in Relationships
---
Frequent emotional texts, rapid escalation in conflict, or difficulty sleeping when upset. May cling tightly to partner or lash out in protest, then feel intense shame afterward.

## 🔄 Growth Edges
---
Build emotional tolerance through breath, regulation, and naming feelings in the moment. Learn that urgency can wait — and connection can hold more space than it seems.
