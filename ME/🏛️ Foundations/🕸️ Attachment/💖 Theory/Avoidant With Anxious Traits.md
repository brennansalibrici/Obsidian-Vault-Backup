## üß† What This Theory Proposes
---
This pattern reflects a nervous system that wants connection but doesn‚Äôt trust it will last. The person leads with avoidant behaviors (distance, independence) but often feels emotional urgency underneath.

## üîç What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why someone may pull away during emotional moments, only to feel a strong internal craving for closeness afterward. It also maps the internal tension between seeming self-reliance and hidden longing.

## üß© How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves recognizing the anxious part beneath the avoidant mask. This style grows by acknowledging emotional needs and reducing the impulse to preemptively disconnect when things feel too intimate.
