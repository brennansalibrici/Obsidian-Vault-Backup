## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Fearful-avoidant attachment forms when a caregiver is both a source of love and threat. The child wants connection but has learned it can be dangerous. This creates internal conflict: the nervous system is split between reaching and retreating.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
It explains push-pull behavior, emotional inconsistency, and the felt sense of “I want you close, but I can’t let you in.” It also highlights the shame that often follows attempts at intimacy or authenticity.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing begins with learning to recognize that safety and connection can coexist. Therapeutic work focuses on self-trust, boundary repair, and tolerating stable emotional presence. Parts work and somatic therapies help separate past threat from current relationship possibilities.
