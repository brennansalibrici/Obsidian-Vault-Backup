## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Earned secure from avoidant suggests a person has worked to overcome emotional numbing or self-isolation by learning safe, reciprocal connection. They can now experience closeness without panic — but old instincts still flare under stress.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Helps explain occasional emotional shutdown, difficulty expressing needs, or resistance to repair even in people who are generally secure. These reflexes don’t mean regression — they’re echoes.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
The task is to notice those echoes and soften them. Choose connection again. Use breath, presence, and relational anchors to stay instead of split.
