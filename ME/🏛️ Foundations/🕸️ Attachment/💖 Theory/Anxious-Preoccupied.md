## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Anxious-preoccupied attachment forms when a caregiver is inconsistently available — sometimes attuned, sometimes unavailable. This creates uncertainty in the child about whether love and attention will be sustained. As adults, these individuals often crave closeness but fear it will disappear.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory explains behaviors like emotional chasing, hypervigilance to rejection, overexplaining, or excessive checking in. It sheds light on why reassurance is sought constantly — not out of insecurity alone, but as a survival mechanism.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves developing a secure base within. This means building emotional regulation, learning to tolerate uncertainty, and recognizing that anxiety doesn’t always signal danger. EMDR, IFS, and relational repair models help by building earned security through consistent presence and mirrored experience.
