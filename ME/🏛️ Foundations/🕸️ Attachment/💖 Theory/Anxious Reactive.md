## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Anxious reactive attachment amplifies emotional responses as a way to prevent abandonment. The nervous system goes into “grab and hold” mode — using intensity to protect connection.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains emotional flooding, over-apologizing, checking, and sometimes even verbal spiraling. These are attempts to soothe abandonment anxiety — not manipulation.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves practicing containment and internal grounding before responding. Naming the fear beneath the urgency helps restore clarity and reduce relational volatility.
