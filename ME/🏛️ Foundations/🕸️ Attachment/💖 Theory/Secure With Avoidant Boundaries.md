## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This variant shows up when someone functions securely most of the time but tightens emotional boundaries rapidly when closeness feels intrusive. They value connection, but space feels non-negotiable.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why secure individuals may seem distant during conflict or suddenly pull back after connection deepens. These are avoidant echoes used to preserve autonomy.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Practice softening the boundary without dissolving it. Name what you need directly. Stay emotionally in the room while holding your right to space.
