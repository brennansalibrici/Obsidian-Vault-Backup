## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Earned secure from mixed origin recognizes that some people heal from multiple attachment wounds — anxious, avoidant, or disorganized — and craft a secure foundation through deep, layered work.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains lingering moments of self-doubt, identity wobble, or relational hyper-awareness even within a mostly secure framework. Recognizes the complexity of healing without pathologizing old survival instincts.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Integration means holding both: the strength of your current secure behavior and the tenderness of where you’ve come from. Tools like journaling, parts work, and emotional reflection help reinforce the secure identity even when old voices whisper.
