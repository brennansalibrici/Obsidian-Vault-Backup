## üß† What This Theory Proposes
---
This theory reflects the path from anxious attachment into earned secure functioning. Through healing relationships or inner work, the person develops enough internal stability to regulate without constant external validation.

## üîç What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why someone can appear confident and connected but may still spike into distress if a partner withdraws or conflict arises. The attachment fear is quieter, but not erased.

## üß© How It Integrates With Healing
---
Ongoing work involves reminding yourself that connection can survive disconnection. Self-soothing, internal reassurance, and conflict repair help reinforce earned security over time.
