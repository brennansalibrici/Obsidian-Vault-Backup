## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Dismissive-avoidant attachment forms when caregivers are emotionally distant, unresponsive, or discourage vulnerability. The child learns to suppress emotional needs and rely solely on themselves. In adulthood, this manifests as difficulty with closeness, preference for control, and an instinct to withdraw in the face of intimacy.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory explains why some people seem detached, disinterested, or aloof in relationships — it’s not lack of care, but a deep fear of losing self in emotional enmeshment. It also sheds light on why emotional needs can feel shameful or weak to them.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves learning to feel safe in closeness and emotional expression. Somatic awareness, relational co-regulation, and compassionate inner work help the avoidant system soften. IFS and polyvagal-informed therapy can support integration through nervous system safety and gentle exposure to vulnerability.
