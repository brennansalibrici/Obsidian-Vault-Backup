## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Disorganized unresolved attachment reflects a fractured internal system — usually due to severe trauma or chronic neglect. The attachment system wants to bond, but the nervous system associates connection with danger. Without resolution, this creates chronic inner chaos.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory helps explain freezing during conflict, self-erasure, identity disorganization, and emotional whiplash. It gives language to intense ambivalence around love, loyalty, and belonging — as well as memory gaps and somatic overwhelm.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves restoring coherence. Trauma-informed therapy (like EMDR or SE), parts work, and slow safe connection help rewire internal safety. The work centers on integrating fragmented self-states and developing safe internal witnesses.
