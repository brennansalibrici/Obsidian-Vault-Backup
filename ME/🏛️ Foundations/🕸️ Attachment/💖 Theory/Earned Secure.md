## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Earned secure attachment forms not through early caregiving, but through later healing. It suggests that individuals can rewire their attachment system when given enough safety, presence, and reflective growth. This concept gives hope that attachment isn’t destiny — it’s adaptable.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory explains how people can move from fear-based patterns to stability. It’s common in those who have done intensive personal work or experienced corrective emotional experiences in therapy or relationships.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Earned secure attachment is both a goal and a process. Integration requires recognizing old patterns when they flare, choosing new responses, and continuing to develop safe relational spaces. It also involves becoming a secure base for others — without losing internal clarity or care.
