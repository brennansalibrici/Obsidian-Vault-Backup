## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This attachment style shuts down emotional systems to prevent exposure. When emotion becomes too intense or unfamiliar, the person disconnects completely from themselves and others.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains blankness during stress, memory loss around conflict, and emotional numbness. What looks like indifference is often trauma-based disconnection.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing begins with subtle reconnection — noticing micro-emotions and sensations. Movement, breath, and co-regulation slowly rebuild internal access to feelings and relational presence.
