## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This theory reflects someone who has done deep inner work to overcome disorganized relational trauma. They’ve rebuilt safety inside themselves and learned how to show up in relationships without fragmenting.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why secure people may still wrestle with sudden shame, freezing, or ambivalence. Their early nervous system was trained to fear connection — but their adult system is learning to stay.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Sustain secure behaviors. Tend to internal parts with compassion. Create rituals that stabilize presence. Trust that moments of fracture don’t undo all you’ve become.
