## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This style reflects a secure person whose early trauma still leaves echoes — moments of reactivity, shame, or pull-back when triggered. They know how to stay, but sometimes forget in the moment.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains sudden shutdowns or emotional spirals that feel “out of character.” These are trauma-based echoes, not regressions.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
The goal is not perfection, but congruence. Notice when you slip into old wiring, then come back to your secure center. You already know how to return.
