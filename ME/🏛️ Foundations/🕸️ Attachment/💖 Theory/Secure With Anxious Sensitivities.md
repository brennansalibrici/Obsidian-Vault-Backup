## üß† What This Theory Proposes
---
Secure-with-anxious-sensitivities describes someone who functions securely most of the time but may experience flashes of anxious reactivity. This often arises in higher-stress relational contexts or with certain attachment cues tied to old wounds.

## üîç What It Helps Explain
---
Explains moments of emotional ‚Äúspikes‚Äù like over-apologizing, reassurance-seeking, or fear of being too much ‚Äî despite otherwise secure relating. Helps differentiate transient emotional flares from full-blown insecure patterns.

## üß© How It Integrates With Healing
---
Reinforcing emotional self-trust is key. When old fears arise, secure individuals can ground, express needs cleanly, and return to relational repair. Practice lies in naming needs and allowing connection to hold uncertainty.
