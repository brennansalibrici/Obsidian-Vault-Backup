## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This pattern forms when emotional chaos or shame taught someone to go invisible. Rather than act out, they disappear inward — often disconnecting from both their pain and others.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains flat affect, difficulty asking for help, chronic “I’m fine” posturing, or somatic disconnection. Underneath is often deep emotional grief and a fear of being too messy to belong.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing invites re-connection to the inner emotional body — slowly, gently, with no performance. Safe relational space helps coax the withdrawn parts into contact without judgment.
