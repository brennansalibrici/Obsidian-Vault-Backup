## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This theory describes someone whose dominant instinct is to pursue connection, but who hides, deflects, or numbs their emotions when closeness becomes vulnerable or overwhelming.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why someone may seem needy or reassurance-seeking one moment and emotionally withdrawn the next. There’s often internal shame around being “too much,” which leads to avoidant compensation behaviors.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves staying with your truth, even if it feels awkward or risky. This style grows by gently resisting the urge to self-abandon in the name of keeping harmony.
