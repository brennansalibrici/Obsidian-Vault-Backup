## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Disorganized reactive attachment emerges when a child’s emotional world is shaped by instability, shame, or emotional chaos. They learn to adapt by becoming whoever they need to be — often reactive, intense, or shut down. Their sense of self may feel fragmented or unsafe.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory helps explain identity confusion, shame storms, emotional outbursts followed by withdrawal, and chronic “never enough” feelings. It also maps how early survival responses become adult relational patterns.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing involves creating internal safety and a coherent sense of identity. IFS, EMDR, and cognitive reframing help soften inner criticism and rebuild trust in one's own emotions and worth. Parts work is especially powerful in integrating fragmented self-states.
