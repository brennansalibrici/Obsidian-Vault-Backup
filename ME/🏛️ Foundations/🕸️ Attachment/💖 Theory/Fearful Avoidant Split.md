notes: This subtype features extreme internal splits — often toggling between intense longing and panic-driven retreat. Usually rooted in high-conflict or high-need childhood systems.

## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
This style reflects deep fragmentation — parts of the self that crave closeness and parts that panic in response. The individual may desperately want love but feel trapped or smothered once it's offered.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains sudden flips between connection and disconnection, idealization and devaluation, or “come close” and “go away” behavior.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Healing means holding both parts with care. You can want love *and* fear it. With therapy, parts work, and safe connection, those splits begin to soften — and you begin to unify.
