## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Anxious-avoidant mixed attachment develops when the early environment gives both clingy and rejecting signals. The child never knows whether closeness is welcomed or punished. As adults, they may chase intimacy and simultaneously fear being trapped or overwhelmed.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
It explains why someone may seem intensely connected and then suddenly go cold. They may want security but struggle to tolerate emotional intimacy. This theory also highlights the deep fear of being “too much” and “not enough” all at once.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
The work is to stabilize emotional presence — learning to stay, express, and receive without extremes. EFT, IFS, and polyvagal approaches help regulate the nervous system and build trust in consistency over time.
