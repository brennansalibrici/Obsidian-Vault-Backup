## üß† What This Theory Proposes
---
Attachment System Sensitization refers to a pattern in which the attachment system becomes hyper-reactive ‚Äî interpreting small relational cues as major signs of rejection, abandonment, or threat. It stems from developmental environments where caregiving was inconsistent, unpredictable, or contingent on performance. 

Rather than turning off, the attachment system in these individuals turns *up* ‚Äî scanning constantly for reassurance, closeness, and signs of safety, often through protest, clinging, or emotional overfunctioning. It‚Äôs not a flaw ‚Äî it‚Äôs an adaptation that kept connection alive in uncertain terrain.

## üîç What It Helps Explain
---
This theory explains why some individuals seem to ‚Äúneed too much‚Äù or get labeled as dramatic, needy, or emotionally dependent. It offers clarity around emotional protest behavior, chronic reassurance-seeking, and the deep internal belief that connection is fragile or fleeting.

It also sheds light on the shame that can follow these behaviors ‚Äî especially in those who long for secure attachment but feel embarrassed by how desperately they need it.

## üß© How It Integrates With Healing
---
Understanding this pattern allows for both self-compassion and skill-building. It invites awareness of the nervous system‚Äôs protective overdrive and supports the move toward internal regulation, clearer boundaries, and relational trust that isn‚Äôt contingent on constant external confirmation.

Modalities like EFT, somatic therapy, and parts work (IFS) are especially helpful for building tolerance to emotional distance, reducing protest behavior, and re-parenting the inner system.

The path forward is not about silencing attachment needs ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *soothing the fire alarm* so real connection can feel safe, steady, and mutual.
