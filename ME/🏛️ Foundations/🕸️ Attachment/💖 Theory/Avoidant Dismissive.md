## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Avoidant dismissive attachment suggests that early emotional needs were rejected or met with irritation. To stay connected, the child learned to need nothing.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
Explains why some people value logic, self-reliance, and stoicism — and feel threatened by emotional expression. Their withdrawal isn’t lack of care, it’s habit formed from early pain.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Integration involves validating that emotional needs are human, not weak. Gradually naming and expressing emotions — especially in safe, low-stakes relationships — helps thaw the freeze.
