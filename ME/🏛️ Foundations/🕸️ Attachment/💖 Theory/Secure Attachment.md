## 🧠 What This Theory Proposes
---
Secure attachment develops when caregivers consistently respond with attunement, emotional safety, and dependable presence. This fosters a sense of internal security, allowing the child to explore, express, and connect freely. In adulthood, secure individuals tend to feel confident in relationships, trust easily, and recover from emotional ruptures with resilience.

## 🔍 What It Helps Explain
---
This theory explains why some individuals feel grounded in both intimacy and autonomy — they trust that connection doesn’t require performance or self-abandonment. It also reveals how emotional repair and co-regulation work in securely bonded relationships.

## 🧩 How It Integrates With Healing
---
Even if someone didn’t begin with secure attachment, they can move toward it through emotionally safe relationships, therapeutic attunement, and inner re-parenting work. Modalities like EMDR, IFS, and somatic-based therapies often aim to build earned security through nervous system repair and relational rewiring.
