## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need is about emotional confidence — the sense that your bond is steady, safe, and not constantly at risk of collapse. It’s the difference between walking on eggshells and standing on solid ground in a relationship.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Triggered by relational ambiguity, inconsistency, or emotional volatility. When a partner frequently pulls away, shuts down, or reacts unpredictably, this need screams for reassurance and safety.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.”  
“We can handle hard things together.”  
“You don’t have to test this — we’re okay.”  
“Even when we mess up, we repair. I want this with you.”
