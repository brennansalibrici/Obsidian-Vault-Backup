## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need says: “Please live in the same emotional world with me.” It’s not about agreement — it’s about alignment. It means feeling like your experience is real, valid, and felt by someone else.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Flares when someone feels gaslit, corrected, or brushed off. When they express something vulnerable and the response distorts, dismisses, or redirects it.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“You’re not the only one feeling this.”  
“I feel it too — you’re not imagining it.”  
“That lands the same way in me.”  
“You’re not alone in how you experienced this.”
