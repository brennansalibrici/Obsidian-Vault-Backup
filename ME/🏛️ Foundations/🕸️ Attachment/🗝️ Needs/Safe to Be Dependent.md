## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This is the need to lean — to not carry everything alone. It asks: “Can I count on you without feeling weak or ashamed?” It’s the childlike longing for support that won’t be used against you.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Flares when someone is sick, overwhelmed, exhausted, or emotionally raw — and they fear asking for help will backfire. It’s often rooted in past experiences where needing others felt dangerous or disappointing.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“You can lean on me.”  
“You don’t have to do this alone.”  
“I’m glad you reached for me — I want to be here for you.”  
“It’s okay to need me sometimes.”
