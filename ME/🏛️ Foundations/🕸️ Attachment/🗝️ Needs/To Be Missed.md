## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need asks: “Would you notice if I were gone?” It’s the ache to feel like your presence makes a difference — not just for what you do, but for who you are.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Triggered after periods of absence, silence, or emotional distance — especially if no one reaches out or reflects missing them. Pain sharpens when presence is taken for granted.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I noticed you weren’t around — I really missed you.”  
“It’s not the same when you’re gone.”  
“You matter enough to leave a gap.”  
“I don’t just see you when you’re here — I feel it when you’re not.”
