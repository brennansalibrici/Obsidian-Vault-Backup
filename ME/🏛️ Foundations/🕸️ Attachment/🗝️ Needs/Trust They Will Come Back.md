## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need says: “If you walk away, will you return?” It’s the longing to trust that temporary distance — whether physical or emotional — won’t mean abandonment. It wants to know that relationships can bend without breaking.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often triggered by conflict, space-taking, or withdrawal. If someone has experienced sudden emotional cutoffs or unpredictable losses, even brief silence can feel like abandonment.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I just need a little space, but I’ll be back.”  
“We’re okay — I still care even when I’m quiet.”  
“I’m not leaving you.”  
“Distance doesn’t mean disconnection.”
