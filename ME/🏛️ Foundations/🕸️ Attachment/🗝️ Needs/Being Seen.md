## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
Being seen is about emotional recognition — the sense that your presence registers and your truth matters. It says: “Notice me without me needing to perform.”

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Triggered by emotional neglect, being talked over, or receiving praise for roles rather than realness. Often flares when someone shows up but feels emotionally passed by.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I noticed that shift in you — how are you doing?”  
“You don’t have to try so hard — I already see you.”  
“You’re not invisible here.”  
“I’m paying attention — not just to what you do, but how you feel.”
