## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need is about reliability — knowing that someone will do what they say and stay consistent over time. It allows trust to grow. Without it, connection feels unsafe no matter how good it looks in the moment.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Triggered by broken promises, inconsistency, or emotional flakiness. Even small letdowns can reopen deeper wounds when this need is unmet.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I meant what I said — and I’ll follow through.”  
“I want you to feel like you can trust my presence.”  
“You don’t have to brace yourself with me.”  
“I show up — especially when it matters most.”
