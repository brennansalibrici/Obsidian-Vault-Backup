## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need reflects the desire to be felt — for someone to pick up on your internal state without you having to spell it out. Emotional attunement is the moment when you’re mirrored accurately and held in your feeling.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often flares when someone feels emotionally missed, misread, or dismissed. It's especially sharp when you're vulnerable and the other person responds with logic, advice, or silence instead of resonance.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I can feel how hard that was.”  
“You don’t have to explain it all — I feel you.”  
“I’m here with you — not just listening, but really sensing you.”  
“You’re not alone in what you feel.”
