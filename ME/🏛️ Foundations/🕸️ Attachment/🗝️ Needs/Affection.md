## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
Affection is how love gets *felt*. It’s the hug, the glance, the gentle hand squeeze that says “I like you — not just love you.” It’s about experiencing warmth that expects nothing in return.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Flares when someone feels coldness, withholding, or lack of affirming contact. May also rise when affection is only given in exchange for performance or compliance.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I just love being near you.”  
“You’re easy to care about.”  
“I wanted to say this — not because you earned it, but because it’s true.”  
“I like showing you how much I care.”
