## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need asks: “Will you stay when I come undone?” It’s the desire to be held in chaos — not cleaned up or sent away. It says, “Please stay close when I can’t keep it together.”

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Flares in moments of emotional overwhelm, grief, or collapse. Especially sharp if past experiences taught them they had to be strong, composed, or invisible in distress.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“You don’t have to hold it all together right now.”  
“I’m not afraid of your mess.”  
“I’m here for the parts of you that can’t hold it anymore.”  
“You can come apart here — and I’ll stay.”
