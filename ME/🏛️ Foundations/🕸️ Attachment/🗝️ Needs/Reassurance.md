## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
Reassurance is the soft anchor in stormy seas. It doesn’t solve the storm — it says, “You’re not alone.” It’s about knowing that the connection still holds, especially when shame or fear whispers that it doesn’t.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often flares during silence, disconnection, or perceived withdrawal. Even small shifts in tone or rhythm can activate deep panic or protest.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“We’re still good — nothing has changed.”  
“You didn’t mess anything up — I care about you.”  
“I’m not going anywhere.”  
“You’re safe in this connection — even when it’s hard.”
