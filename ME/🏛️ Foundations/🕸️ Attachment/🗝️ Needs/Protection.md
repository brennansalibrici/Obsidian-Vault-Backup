## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need longs to feel shielded — not just emotionally, but physically or spiritually protected. It says: “Let me rest while you take the hit.” It asks, “Will anyone step up for me?”

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Gets triggered when someone feels exposed, defenseless, or abandoned in distress. Often stems from moments where no one protected them when they needed it most.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“You don’t have to protect yourself right now — I’ve got you.”  
“I’ll step in if you’re being hurt.”  
“You’re not in this alone anymore.”  
“I’ll fight for you, not against you.”
