## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
This need speaks to the longing to be desired — not just useful, helpful, or reliable. It says: “I want to be chosen because of who I am, not what I do.” It's the ache of someone who has always filled roles but rarely been emotionally pursued.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often shows up when someone feels needed for their function (e.g., providing, fixing, caregiving) but emotionally unseen. Triggers include transactional connection, feeling used, or being valued only when productive.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I want you — not just what you do for me.”  
“You don’t have to earn your place here.”  
“I desire you for who you are.”  
“You matter even when you're not helping.”
