## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
The longing to be chosen — not by default or obligation, but as an act of clear, willing love. It asks, “Would you still pick me if you could pick anyone?” It’s about feeling emotionally claimed and uniquely valued.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often surfaces when someone feels compared, overlooked, or uncertain of their place in a relationship. Triggers include romantic competition, conditional love, or past experiences of being rejected or replaced.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I choose you.”  
“I don’t want anyone else.”  
“You’re not just convenient — you matter to me.”  
“You don’t have to earn your place with me.”
