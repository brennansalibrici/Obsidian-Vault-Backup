## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
Connection is the foundation of attachment — a felt sense that someone is with you, tracking you, and emotionally available. It says: “You matter. I’m still with you.”

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often surfaces during emotional misattunement, rupture, or conflict. A partner who turns away, deflects, or goes silent can spark fear or shame — especially if connection was once fragile or unsafe.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“We’re okay — I still feel close.”  
“Even if we’re in conflict, I’m with you.”  
“You’re not alone in this moment.”  
“Let’s reconnect.”
