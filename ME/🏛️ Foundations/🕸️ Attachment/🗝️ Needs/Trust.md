## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
Trust is the quiet backbone of attachment. It asks: “Can I relax into this? Can I believe you mean what you say — and will still mean it tomorrow?” It’s not about perfection — it’s about reliability with heart.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Gets triggered when people break their word, shift suddenly, or appear emotionally incongruent. For those with relational trauma, even small inconsistencies can reopen deep fear.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I meant it — and I still mean it.”  
“You don’t have to brace yourself with me.”  
“I want to rebuild trust if it’s been shaken.”  
“I’ll stay steady even when things feel hard.”
