## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
The longing to feel emotionally close, to know someone is near and attuned. It’s about nearness — not just physically, but in spirit. Closeness calms the nervous system and creates felt safety.

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Gets triggered when someone senses emotional distance, ambiguity, or perceived abandonment. Silence, separation, or even subtle disinterest can spark anxiety or protest.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I’m not going anywhere.”  
“I want to be close to you.”  
“You’re not too much.”  
“Let’s just sit near each other — I’m here.”
