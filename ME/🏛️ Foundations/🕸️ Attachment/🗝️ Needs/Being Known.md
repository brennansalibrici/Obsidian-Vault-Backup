## 🤝 What This Need Reflects
---
The desire to be known — not just admired, needed, or tolerated, but understood in depth. It says: “See behind my behavior. Know what’s true beneath my defenses.”

## 🧲 When It Gets Activated
---
Often surfaces when someone feels emotionally invisible or falsely assumed. Moments of disconnection, stereotype, or misreading spark a deep longing to feel understood and accurately held.

## 🗣️ What It Longs to Hear
---
“I see you.”  
“I know that tone means something deeper — want to talk?”  
“I’m still with you, even now.”  
“You don’t have to explain everything — I already feel it.”
