Name: Helping The Boy Out Of The Cave

## Context
---
This all came about after the storm that occurred after I got Lori new socks after accidentally splashing hot tub water on her feet.

## Reflection 
---
In my EMDR session, I (as a 3rd person) went into the cave to find that boy and i stayed with him until he was ready to come out. When he was ready, I helped him come out of the cave. Perhaps this isn't so much symbolic of the past or what's happening with EMDR; perhaps its real meaning is in that is what I have to do for myself to get me out of my cave
