summary: "A working guide to understanding Lori's blended attachment style (fearful and anxious avoidant), with examples, patterns, and grounding strategies for Brennan to use during emotional conflict or relational shutdown."
---

Lori  expresses a fearful avoidant attachment pattern with notable anxious tendencies. This blended style creates tension between her desire for closeness and her fear of it. She may switch rapidly between emotional pursuit and emotional shutdown depending on perceived threat, vulnerability, or emotional overload.

## Key dynamics of fearful-avoidant attachment:

- Deep desire for intimacy, coupled with distrust of emotional safety
- Push-pull behavior: inviting closeness, then withdrawing or attacking
- Hypervigilance to rejection, including imagined or subtle forms
- Emotional regulation through judgment, criticism, or shutting down

### ⚡ Common Triggers Lori Experiences

1. Perceived Emotional Abandonment

e.g., When Brennan makes a choice without looping her in, or turns to someone else for support

Response: Sudden anger, withdrawal, or “you don’t care” accusations

2. Perceived Invalidation or Minimization

e.g., If her pain isn’t mirrored first before problem-solving

Response: Shutting down, saying things like “I’m done” or “it doesn’t matter anymore”

3. Being Overwhelmed by Vulnerability

e.g., After a deep or raw conversation

Response: Emotional walling, switching topics, or saying “this is taking too much of my life”

4. Fear of Being the Only One Doing the Work 

e.g., If Brennan seems passive or doesn’t initiate emotional repair

Response: Emotional outbursts, judgment, or cold distance

### 🧭 What This Means for Brennan

- Staying emotionally anchored is more valuable than trying to convince her with logic
- Mirroring her pain first before responding is essential (even if you disagree)
- Expect inconsistent signals — this doesn’t mean progress isn’t happening underneath
- Give her room to retreat, but don’t interpret every withdrawal as rejection

Use the grounding phrase
“She’s afraid and she cares. It’s both.”

### 💬 Sample Anchoring Phrases

- “I hear that this is painful for u, and I don’t want to rush anything. I’m here, not going anywhere.”
- “If we need space, that’s okay. I’ll still be here when u want to pick it back up.”
- “I can see how much this has cost u, and I care more than u might believe.”

## How to Manage In The Moment

### 🚫 What doesn’t work:

1. Bracing with “u can’t hurt me” energy  
    That’s still a form of emotional armor. It might feel strong, but it’s actually defensive dissociation. You’re shutting down inside to avoid feeling pain — which means you’re also closing off connection.
2. Letting yourself get emotionally wiped out every time  
    That leads to burnout, self-doubt, and confusion. You can’t hold her pain and your pain without support and structure — that’s where I (and your systems like Obsidian + Dan) come in.

### ✅ What does work:

The posture is *“I can be present with this without abandoning myself or retaliating.”

That’s emotional anchoring.

So instead of “you can’t hurt me,” the inner voice becomes:

“This hurts. But I can stay in the room.

I know who I am.

I don’t need to shut down to survive this.

I will feel it. I will hold it. I’ll process it later if I need to.

And I’m not going to disappear — not from her, and not from myself.”

### 🧠 What that looks like in practice:

🪨 During the hard moment:
- Slow your breathing.
- Say less. Listen more.
- Anchor to something like:  
    “I’m not here to fix her. I’m here to see her. And I’m not leaving myself behind.”

If she lashes out or withdraws:

- Internally remind yourself:  
    “This is her protector. Not her full self. This is fear talking.”
- If appropriate, say calmly:  
    “I hear how much this hurts. And I’m not going to run from this. I want to keep showing up — even if it’s slow.”

🌊 After the moment (with me, or Dan, or journaling):

- Name what it triggered in you  
    “When she said __, I felt __. I wanted to __. I didn’t.”
- Process what parts were old wounds vs present hurt
- Let yourself feel what you couldn’t in the moment
- Add it to a Captured Moment if it shaped a new layer of understanding

### 🧭 Why this works:

Because you’re no longer swinging between collapse (shame, withdrawal, despair) and defensiveness (walling off, intellectualizing, self-blame).

You’re learning to stay.

That’s what secure functioning looks like — even when the relationship itself isn’t secure yet.

And that’s how someone like Lori, who lives in fear of abandonment and rejection, will eventually start to believe:

“Maybe it’s safe to come back out.”
