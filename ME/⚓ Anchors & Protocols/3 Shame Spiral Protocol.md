## _How to interrupt collapse, reclaim your center, and return to Safe Brennan_
---
### 🔹 **What’s Happening in a Shame Spiral**
Shame says:
> _“You’re not just wrong—you ARE wrong.  
> You’re the problem. You always screw it up.  
> And nothing you do will ever be enough.”_

It’s not a feeling. It’s an **identity takeover**.  
So this protocol is about **getting your Self back.**

---
## 🔁 **Step 1: Call It What It Is**
> “I’m in a shame spiral.”

Say it out loud if possible. If not, whisper it internally.  
This names the storm—and names _you_ as separate from it.

Then say:
> _“This is not truth. This is a trauma echo.”_

You may not _feel_ that’s true yet. Doesn’t matter. Saying it slows the descent.

## 🫂 **Step 2: Locate Safe Brennan (Or the Self That Knows)**
> Ask: “If Safe Brennan were here right now, what would he say to me?”

Let him speak:
- _“This hurts, but it doesn’t define me.”_
- _“I’m not a lost cause—I’m a hurting person.”_
- _“I can stay with myself, even when I feel like shit.”_

Let those words land, even if only 10% of you believes them.

## 🪨 **Step 3: Find Ground**

Shame is a head spin. You need **body grounding**.

Try one:
- Touch something cold (sink, doorknob, drink).
- Press your feet into the floor.
- Say what you see around you:
    > _“I see a chair. I see a desk. I see my hands.”_

This is your anchor to the present.  
_Shame lives in memory. Safety lives in the now._

## 🧾 **Step 4: Disarm the Story**

Ask yourself:
- _“What am I telling myself is true about me right now?”_  
    (e.g., “I ruin everything.” “I’m too much.”)

Then ask:
- _“Is this fact—or is this a fear I’ve had since I was little?”_

You’ll usually find it’s an old tape.

Now respond with:
> _“That may have felt true when I was 7. But I’m not 7 anymore.”_

## 🌱 **Step 5: Reenter Connection Gently**

Don’t rush to fix everything. Start small.
- Text someone: _“Hey, I’m struggling today. Just wanted to say hi.”_
- Step back into the Safe Brennan protocol if needed.
- If the shame spiral was triggered by Lori, say:
    > _“I got hit by a shame wave just now. I’m trying to get back to solid ground. I’ll check back in when I’ve found it.”_

This signals **awareness, responsibility, and emotional maturity**—without offloading.
