- That was hurtful and I hate that I did that
- That wasn't okay and I wish I could go back and do it differently
- You didn't deserve that
- I see how much that hurt
- That didn't reflect how much I care. I want to do better
- If I were in your shoes, I think I'd feel the same way
- I can see now how much that must have hurt and I hate that I didn't see it sooner
- It matters to me that this landed that way; I see that it did even if I didn't mean for it to
- You've carried way too much of that pain alone and for way too long. That's not okay
- You matter too much to me for this to keep happening
