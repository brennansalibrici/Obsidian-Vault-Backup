## **Safe Brennan Protocol** - _How to Grow Up Emotionally One Moment at a Time_

---
### **Step 1: Pause When the Wound Fires**
> The moment I feel unheard, shut down, invisible, or like I don’t matter—**STOP.**  
> Don’t trust the first reaction. That’s 2nd Grade Brennan.  
> Don’t explain. Don’t fix. Don’t defend.  
> **Just pause—and go to Step 2.**
---
### **Step 2: Reparent in Real Time**
> This isn’t about pushing through—it’s about taking back the wheel.

**What TO DO:**
- Take a breath.
- Silently say:
    > _“Okay little guy… I see u. U’re scared and overwhelmed. But I’ve got u now. I’m here.”_
- **Physically ground**: Sit up. Plant your feet. Put a hand on your chest.
    **Keep it simple**:
    > _“We’re not alone now. I’m learning. I won’t abandon u.”_
---
### **Step 3: Shift Into Safe Brennan**
> Now that I’ve paused and calmed my younger self, I choose how I show up next.

**What TO DO:**
#### Use the 3-Part Mirroring Formula:
1. **Name what she’s feeling**
    > _“U sound really hurt.”_
2. **Say why it matters / makes sense**
    > _“After everything u’ve carried, of course it would.”_
3. **Let her know it’s safe to share**
    > _“U don’t have to hold that alone. I’m here.”_

**If flooded and can’t mirror yet, say:**
> _“I want to respond like Safe Brennan. I just need a second to find him again.”_
---
### **Step 4: Journal the Aftermath**
> No shame. Just growth. This is where the rewiring happens.

**Ask yourself:**
1. _What triggered 2nd Grade Brennan?_
2. _What did Safe Brennan try to do—even a little?_
3. _What can I do 1% better next time?_

Even if you failed, this step builds muscle. Every rep counts.

### **Step 5: Practice the Reps on the Calm Days**
> Emotional maturity is built **before** the storm.

**What TO DO:**
- Reflect daily: _“What did Safe Brennan do today?”_
    Celebrate small wins: _“I caught the spiral before it started.”_
    Use peaceful moments to practice validation and grounding—even in tiny ways.
    
> Safe Brennan isn’t built by force.  
> He’s built by **consistency, compassion, and courage.**
