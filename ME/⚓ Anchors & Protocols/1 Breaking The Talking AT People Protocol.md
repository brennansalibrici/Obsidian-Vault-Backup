## **Purpose:** 
Break inherited monologue-style communication and shift toward connection-based engagement.

## **The Problem (Core Pattern)**

You’ve been taught to “earn” connection by doing things _for_ people—without relational engagement, emotional curiosity, or consent.  
When the other person doesn’t respond with praise or gratitude, your nervous system crashes into hurt, shame, and _beat puppy_ mode.

This pattern comes from survival, not malice. But it leads to **objectifying behavior** even in loving relationships.  
And now that you see it, you want out. This is your roadmap.
## **When to Use:**

- During relational conflict or emotional disconnect
- When tempted to over-explain, defend, or emotionally withdraw

## 🔁 Step 1: **Interrupt the Auto-Performance**

“Am I doing this _at_ them or _with_ them?”
Before you act, pause and run this **4-question check:**

1. Have I emotionally connected with them—or am I guessing their need?
2. Have I imagined how they _should_ respond?
3. Would I feel hurt or resentful if they don’t react positively?
4. Am I trying to fix or impress without being asked?

If you check 2+ → Stop.  
This is likely a Performer move. Don’t continue yet.

## 🧭 Step 2: **Choose Curiosity Over Control**

What TO DO instead:

- Ask yourself:
    >_“What might actually be happening inside them right now?”_  
    > _“Have I been curious about how they feel—or just focused on what I’m doing?”_
    
- If it’s relationally safe (like with Lori), you can say:
    > _“I was about to do this thing for u, but I’m realizing I haven’t really checked in with where u’re at. Would this feel good to u—or am I missing what matters right now?”_
    
- If you don’t feel safe asking:
    > Don’t abandon the action—but reframe it:  
    > _“I’m doing this as a gift. No expectations. They’re not responsible for my emotional payoff.”_

## 🪞 Step 3: Watch the Expectation Shadow

Even if you move forward with care, **expectation will still creep in.**

What TO DO:
- Before giving or acting, whisper to yourself:
    > _“I release the outcome. They’re allowed to respond however they need.”_
    
- If you feel disappointed or ignored:
    - Breathe. Say silently:
        > _“That’s the old Performer pain showing up. It’s okay. I’m not doing this to earn love anymore.”_
        
- Let it hurt—but **don’t collapse**. Process it in your journal, not in their face.

## 🧠 Step 4: Reflect & Rewire

After the moment passes—especially if it stings—ask:

1. _Was I doing something AT them?_
2. _What was I hoping they’d do in return?_
3. _Did I feel crushed when they didn’t?_
4. _What would a Partner have done differently?_

Then write _one sentence_ as the new pattern:
> _“Next time, I’ll ask if they want this instead of assuming.”_  
> _“Next time, I’ll stay curious instead of hurt.”_

That sentence = rewiring.

## 🧱 Step 5: Build the Partner Daily

The Partner doesn’t show up in big dramatic moments. He’s built in the mundane.
What TO DO daily:
- Look for **one moment** a day where you catch yourself mid-performance.
- Pause. Choose curiosity.
- Give without needing applause.

> The Performer seeks response.  
> The Partner seeks relationship.  
> Safe Brennan is the Partner.
