Reflecting on Lori's question about her surgery and how I responded.

What Happened:

I realized something that feels huge: when Lori asks about something that happened-like her surgery, or any eventâ€” it's not really the event details she's looking for. What she's listening for is whether I was emotionally present. Whether I felt something. Whether she mattered to me in that moment. That's what makes her feel safe and loved.

Elia helped me see that for someone with a fearful avoidant attachment style, the emotional subtext is the whole thing.

The real answer she wants isn't "you were in surgery for four hours." It's "I was terrified, I couldn't stop thinking about you, I felt helpless but I stayed with it." That's what connects us.

Total AHA. This helps so much. It's like l've been answering the wrong part of the question my whole life without knowing it. I want to build this into our daily practice: learning to answer the emotional question, even when it's hidden behind a factual one.

Notes for Practice:

Let's build this into our daily rhythm along with mirroring practice. One real or hypothetical moment per day where I practice sharing the emotional layer of an event Lori asks about.
