## Context
---
Realized that some of the emotions l've been feeling — the disorientation, the cautious hope, the bracing for pain even when things are okay — might actually mirror what Lori is going through too. It hit me that she might also be frozen or confused after receiving the message I sent, not because it didn't matter, but because it did.
## Reflection 
---
It surprised me to notice that some of my internal responses — the tension, the vulnerability, the shock when something goes well - might actually be the same for her.

Not in the same words or experience, but in the shape of it.

I wondered for the first time if silence might be heavy for her too — not because she's ignoring me, but because she's quietly processing something that touched her.

This changes how I see the silence. It doesn't have to mean failure or rejection. It might mean she's trying to find her way forward just like I am. And that makes me want to hold space instead of panic.
