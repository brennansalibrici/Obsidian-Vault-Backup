## Context
---
Processing the hard truth about fearful avoidant attachment.

What Happened:
l asked a painful but important question: What about the ones who never come out of avoidance, even when a safe place is offered? Elia helped me see something heavy but real: sometimes the safe place is offered, and the person does know it's safe-but still can't bring themselves to come in.

Fearful avoidants don't just need to believe the door is open

â€”they need to feel safe enough to walk through it. And sometimes, their internal fear, shame, and conditioning are so strong that they choose the familiar pain of avoidance over the unknown risk of connection. That doesn't mean the offer wasn't good enough. It means the prison inside was stronger than the path out.
## Reflection
---
That hurts, bad. Because l've been offering safety. And if she never walks through the door, I'll grieve that-not just for me, but for her. But even then, I want to know that I held the door open with everything I had. That I didn't close it in fear or frustration.
