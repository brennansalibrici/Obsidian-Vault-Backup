## Context
---
Realized for the first time that Lori might not always know how to respond - that silence doesn't always mean rejection, and anger isn't always a clear signal of blame.
Came to see that her trauma may be just as powerful and frozen as mine, and that she might not always have the tools to meet me emotionally, even if she wants to.
## Reflection 
---
This moment shifted something deep in me.

I'm so used to expecting quick, painful reactions that it never occurred to me she might be emotionally shut down, confused, or overwhelmed. Realizing that she's also dealing with her own trauma â€” that she's sometimes lost, scared, unsure - makes me feel compassion instead of just fear.

It helps me stay grounded instead of panicking.

And it helps me see that connection might require patience, not just effort.
