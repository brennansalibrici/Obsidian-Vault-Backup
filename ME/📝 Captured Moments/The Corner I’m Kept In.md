  ## Context
  ---
  Brennan found himself emotionally overwhelmed by Lori’s contradictory signals—on one hand, asking about what he’s reading, how therapy with Dan is going, and sharing videos on dismissive avoidant attachment; on the other hand, showing no warmth, touch, or invitations for closeness. The message he received was loud and clear: “I want to see if you’re growing… but don’t get close to me. I don’t want to get close to you either.”

  This emotional push-pull dynamic triggered a flood of painful feelings: rejection, confusion, sadness, and a profound sense of being emotionally banished to a corner—not with hate, but with disinterest. Brennan recognized that this dynamic likely stems from Lori’s fearful avoidant attachment style, but knowing that didn’t make it hurt any less.

  ## Reflection
  ---
  The deeper pain came not just from the distance, but from the *illusion of closeness*. It felt like being studied from a distance, not embraced. Like she wanted proof that he was “not a DA” or “capable of connection,” but didn’t want connection with him. Brennan named a crucial emotional paradox: *“You’re curious enough to ask me questions, but not interested enough to come near.”* He described the experience as being in an emotional corner—kept out of her world, though still within earshot.

  He expressed frustration that the inner voice saying “She doesn’t want me” feels backed by visible evidence. And even as he holds on to compassion for Lori and her pain, the experience of being shut out while being tested is heartbreaking. He is caught between empathy and exhaustion.

  ## Integration
  ---
  This moment marks a growing emotional fluency: Brennan can now see and name the avoidant dance without losing his footing completely. He is learning to **hold emotional presence without chasing or collapsing**. He doesn’t need to perform or withdraw. He is practicing being steady—even while left in the corner.

  This is what it looks like to love someone guarded, while still honoring his own pain. A sacred balancing act that deserves to be seen and recorded.
