## Reflection
---
In my EMDR session, I (as a 3rd person) went into the cave to find that hurt and broken little boy because I loved him and I wanted him to be ok. I found him hiding in the darkest deepest part of the cave and he didn't want to leave and made it clear he wasn't going to leave. So I sat down with him because I didn't want him to be alone. At first I couldn't even get him to talk to me. Even still I kept talking to him and asking him questions. I asked him if he liked it in here and he said 'No'. I was so excited - it was a reply; a one word reply but he actually said something to me! As I kept at it, his replies grew from one word to a few words. We somehow began to play this little game of flicking small rocks into this little puddle of water that had developed where there was an impression in the rock on the floor of the cave. Of course I let him win and I though this might be my chance to help him get out of the cave so I made a big celebration when we won and then asked him if he wanted to leave and we would go get some ice cream or something like that to celebrate that he won. All the happiness and joy instantly left him and he said no. I felt so terribly bad for him because I knew he didn't like it in the cave and yet nothing I could so would change his mind. I realized that we were going to spend the night in there together and it was getting cold so I wanted to go get some blankets or something to bring back for him so he wouldn't be cold. As I stood up to leave he grabbed my arm with a panicked look of sheer terror on his face and said 'Please don't leave me in here.' My heart broke for this poor boy. I sat right back down with him and wrapped my arms around him. We laid down on the cave floor together and I just held him all night long. I can still remember how the rock and the cave floor hurt my back from the way I was laying on it but I had decided in my mind that no matter what I felt or what bones might break, I was not going to let go of this boy; he needed me so badly and I wasn't about to disturb him. When he woke up, he seemed a little bit different and I asked him again if he wanted to leave and he said 'I will go, but only if you go with me'. I was overjoyed that I could finally lead him out. As soon as we started walking, it was as if he no longer could talk. We were communicating, but it was only with grunts and other caveman type utterances. I took his hand and began to lead him, hopping from stone to stone out of the cave.
