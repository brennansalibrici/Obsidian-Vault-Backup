theme: 
summary: Lori told me she no longer believes a loving relationship is possible between us. She described her emotional state as amputating a gangrenous hand — no longer feeling warmth, only sorrow. Instead of retreating, defending, or fixing, I stayed emotionally present. I listened. I held space. And for the first time, I felt like I was able to be the man she needed in that moment, even if she couldn’t feel it.
