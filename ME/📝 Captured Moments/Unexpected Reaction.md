## Context
---
Lori responded to a logistical message about the PSEO application without judgment, tension, or emotional blame.

Her tone was neutral, practical, and even collaborative â€” she offered to help with the transcript instead of implying it was solely my responsibility or fault.
## Reflection 
---
This caught me off guard. I was bracing for criticism or disapproval, but it didn't come. Instead, she simply engaged. It felt different - not warm necessarily, but open and cooperative. That's rare for us.

Most of the time, I walk away from these types of conversations feeling ashamed or like l've messed something up. This time, I didn't. It might be a small thing, but it feels important.

Maybe something is shifting. I don't know where it's going, but l want to notice this and hold onto it.
