## Notes

### Have I been hiding from her lack of care by initiating so much?
Yes, very possibly. And not out of manipulation or denial, but out of survival. When you love someone as deeply as you love Lori and the connection starts slipping away, it's terrifying to face the silence. So you fill it with texts, questions, jokes. With "just thinking of u"s. Because as long as there's something going back and forth, maybe the relationship isn't dead. Maybe she still cares. So, yeah it may be that part of you was trying to keep the illusion of connection alive, because the alternative felt unbearable. That's not weakness. That's heartbreak refusing to give up. 

But here's the cost:
When you're constantly the one initiating, it becomes hard-if not impossible-to tell whether she's truly engaging or simply responding out of politeness, guilt, or habit and worse, it makes her silence unreadable. You never get to see what she does when you don't prompt it.

### Is backing off and only responding when she reaches out a better way?
In this season, yes. Especially given how far you've come emotionally.
This isn't about playing games or withholding. It's about creating enough quiet for the truth to rise-both for her, and for you.

By backing off:
- ﻿﻿You give Lori the space to reach if she wants to. You'll learn what she chooses to do, not just how she reacts.
- ﻿﻿You stop over functioning, which can blur emotional reality for both of you.
- ﻿﻿You protect your own heart from pouring into a void.

And here's what's powerful: you're still present. Still warm. Still responding gently and openly. You haven't slammed the door-you've just stopped propping it open from your side. That's healthy. That's strong. That's secure.

Final thought:
You've spent years trying to earn love by offering more, more, more. 
But true love doesn't need to be earned-it needs space to choose.
You've finally given her that space. And while it's scary, it's also the only way to know what's real.

### What I Learned
Yes, you were over-initiating in the past-trying to preserve connection, avoid abandonment, and keep the illusion of closeness alive.  It came from fear and longing-a desperate attempt to preserve connection and avoid abandonment. But now, you're learning how to hold the door open without pushing her through it. You're learning the strength of quiet presence, emotional availability, and not abandoning yourself.  I don't have to over-function to keep love alive. I just need to be present, grounded, and available without pressure.

Lori has said:
- ﻿﻿"I'm still here."
- ﻿﻿"I need to see meaningful change over time."

These are not ultimatums-they are breadcrumbs of guarded hope. These aren't empty phrases. They are cautious signals. 
They tell you:
- ﻿﻿She hasn't emotionally or physically exited.
- ﻿﻿She is watching.
- ﻿﻿She is affected, even when she doesn't show it.
- ﻿﻿She hasn't fully shut the door.
- Her fear hasn't fully won.

Even if she seems cold or withdrawn, she hasn't walked away. She's still here. That matters. She is still inside her walls. That's real but the kind of steady, attuned, non-intrusive presence you are building now is the only thing that could possibly help her feel safe enough to risk coming out. Will she come out from behind the walls? We don't know, but she could. Because:
- ﻿﻿Her fear hasn't fully won-she's still here.
- ﻿﻿She names your growth and continues to engage, even if guarded.
- ﻿﻿She hasn't shut the door.

You are becoming exactly the kind of person she said she needs to see and that gives this hope substance.

Where I Am Now:
- ﻿﻿I'm showing up with steadiness.
- ﻿﻿I'm letting silence speak.
- ﻿﻿I'm responding with warmth, not chasing.
- ﻿﻿I'm staying with myself even when it hurts.

What to do with this:
- ﻿﻿Keep the door open. Don't force it.
- ﻿﻿Let her silence speak.  
- Let her have her space without collapsing into fear.
- Stay with yourself. Be the sanctuary-first for you, and maybe one day, again for her.
- Remember that my growth matters, no matter what she chooses.
- ﻿﻿Return to this page when the pain says otherwise and I feel tempted to abandon myself in search of proof that she still cares.

Will She Come Out from the Walls? Truthfully: we don't know, but also truthfully: She could. Because:
- ﻿﻿She hasn't left.
- ﻿﻿She continues to engage, even if guarded.
- ﻿﻿She notices my growth.
- ﻿﻿She's still giving this time.
