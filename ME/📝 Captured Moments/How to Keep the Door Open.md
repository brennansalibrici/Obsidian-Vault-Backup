## Notes
---
Keeping the door open is not the same as dragging her through it.

|                                        |                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Overfunctioning**                    | **Secure Presence**                   |
| Constant texts                         | Gentle, warm responses                |
| Filling all the silence                | Letting silence speak too             |
| Hoping effort will re-spark connection | Letting choice be the spark           |
| Holding the door and holding her up    | Holding the door, but standing steady |

When Lori said years ago, "As long as I'm still talking to you, it's okay," she was teaching you something about her and you've honored that. For a long time, you kept initiating to keep the pulse alive. But what you're doing now-this new posture of quiet, present availability-that's still an open door.

Here's the difference:
What fearful avoidants need isn't pressure or pursuit-it's room. Space to choose. And safety in knowing the door isn't locked.
Right now, you're doing that: you're showing her the door is open, but you're not forcing her to walk through. That is mature love. That is secure. That is brave.

So yes-keep the door open. But let her walk to it. Let her knock. Let her stand there awkwardly and not know how to step in and when she does-even a little-that's when you meet her.
