## Context
---
I became completely overwhelmed to the point of shutting down to acknowledge the reality that not all fearful avoidants recover **but not because it's impossible for them**. Often, its because *their fear won*. Because safety never lasted long enough or because every time they tried to peek their heart out, something (whether inside or outside) slammed the door shut again. So yes, some don't return to connection, but *some do*. And because I don't know what's going to happen with [[Lori Kinney]] I have to accept that there is a real possibility that the woman I love will never love me or even want to connect with me or care about me at all and that is devastating. I was feeling the raw burning center of grief - the kind that feels like it could swallow you whole - because something real is dying: the hope that maybe, just maybe, the woman I love would finally see me and choose me and it especially stings that the moment I finally found my way back to my own heart and feelings is the same moment it gets broken open like this. Its hurts in a way that words can barely touch.
## Reflection

I have finally learned and understand now how to handle emotions and moments like this. 

### 1. Ground your body
Right now your nervous system is likely overwhelmed. You're not just sad, you're *flooded*. This has your mind hardly even on the ground or in reality because your amygdala is in full control of your brain and you need to take control back by doing things like this:

- Sit up. Feel your feet on the floor
- Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell and 1 you can taste
- Breathe. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, and exhale for 6. Repeat and repeat. 

None of this fixes the pain, but it does give some containment so you don't continue to feel like your drowning and it helps to force taking control of your brain back from your amygdala

###  2. Say it plainly
Write it, speak it, whisper it if you have to:

   "I feel alone. I feel like she never really loved me. I feel like I'm waking up to a world where I was never truly seen. I feel scared that my deepest desire - emotional connection - isn't possible for me"

Saying it our loud, even if it's just to yourself makes the grief real. And once it's real, it's bearable. What's unbearable is pretending that it isn't there or running or hiding from it. 

### 3. I Stay With Me
Look at yourself in the 3rd person. Imagine yourself as a child, maybe 8 or 9 years old. Alone. Hurt. Curled up in a corner because they just realized their love wasn't enough to make someone want to stay. What would you say to that child? Could it be something like 'You should have to give everything just to be loved. I'm here now. I see you. You're not crazy. This hurts like hell and its not your fault.' Holding yourself is becoming the one voice in the room that speaks to *him* like he matters. Its exactly what happened with [[The Boy In The Cave#Reflection|The Boy In The Cave]]. 

You don't try and fix him. You don't shame him. You don't tell him to stop crying or toughen up or prove his worth, you just *stay*. You sat in the dark with him. You let him just *be*. You let his pain *matter*. You let *him* matter. Because the pain you're in now - it *his* pain too. That same little boy is still there, crushed by the unbearable weight of not being wanted by the one he loved the most. So maybe its not about doing something different, it's about going back into the cave, back to *him*. Not to rescue him, not to promise it'll all be okay, but just to *be* with him. Maybe just to whisper 'I'm here again. I didn't leave you. I still see you. I still love you. Even if she doesn't. Even if no one else ever does. I'm not walking out.' You're saying through your presence 'Your pain doesn't scare me anymore. You're not too much. I'm not going anywhere.' This is re-parenting. This is emotional resurrection. This is what healing *actually* looks like. 

### 4. Do this over and over again. As many times as it comes up
