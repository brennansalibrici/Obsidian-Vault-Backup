theme: 
summary: After Scrabble and the roof incident, I saw that Lori wasn’t being selfish—she was fighting not to be seen *as* selfish. It connected directly to her childhood, where her narcissistic mother distorted reality and made Lori feel like a burden. I saw her not as cold or harsh, but as someone shaped by pain. And I felt this surge of empathy and fierce protectiveness rise in me. She is not the villain of this story—she’s the survivor of it.
