What Happened:

Lori texted about a friend going into an 8 hour surgery and asked how long her own surgery had been. Recognized that this may not have been about facts, but an emotionally layered bid for connection instead of. treating it like a simple question, I responded with warmth, presence, and a gentle emotional invitation.

I realized something that feels huge: when Lori asks about something that happened-like her surgery, or any eventâ€” it's not really the event details she's looking for. What she's listening for is whether I was emotionally present. Whether I felt something. Whether she mattered to me in that moment. That's what makes her feel safe and loved.

For someone with a fearful avoidant attachment style, the emotional subtext is the whole thing. The real answer she wants isn't "you were in surgery for four hours." It's "I was terrified, I couldn't stop thinking about you, I felt helpless but I stayed with it." That's what connects us.

Total AHA. This helps so much. It's like l've been answering the wrong part of the question my whole life without knowing it. I want to build this into our daily practice: learning to answer the emotional question, even when it's hidden behind a factual one.

I realized she might not be asking About the length of her surgery just for memory's sake. It could be her way of processing something deeper - fear for her friend, grief from her own experience, or testing whether I'd meet her in an emotional place. I'm starting to understand how fearful, avoidant partners often bring up emotionally charged things indirectly - not because they don't care, but because it feels safer. I've seen her do that before, but I didn't have a name for it, period. Now I do. And instead of missing it or reacting to it, I stayed soft and steady.
