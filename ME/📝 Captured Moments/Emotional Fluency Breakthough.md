## Context
---
Lori texted about a friend going into an 8-hour surgery and asked how long her own surgery had been. Recognized that this may not have been about facts, but an emotionally layered bid for connection. Instead of treating it like a simple question, responded with warmth, presence, and a gentle emotional invitation.

## Reflection
---
I realized she might not be asking about the length of her surgery just for memory's sake. It could be her way of processing something deeper - fear for her friend, grief from her own experience, or testing whether l'd meet her in an emotional place. I'm starting to understand how fearful-avoidant partners often bring up emotionally charged things indirectly â€” not because they don't care, but because it feels safer.

I've seen her do that before, but I didn't have a name for it.

Now I do. And instead of missing it or reacting to it, I stayed soft and steady.

## Notes

Attuned, curious, grounded
