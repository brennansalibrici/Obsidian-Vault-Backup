How to Respond if She Brings It Up Again

If Lori says something like, "You never used to reach out when you were on the road," or  "It always felt like I didn't matter when you were gone," You can respond with both accountability and an update.

Like this:

"I hear you. I know that was painful, and you're right— really didn't reach out the way you needed back then. I regret that so much. Lately, l've been trying hard to be present and emotionally available, even if it looks a little quieter than before. I want you to know the door's open— and I'm here. Just not pushing anymore. Not because I don't care, but because I care differently now."

That response does three things:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Validates her pain (no defensiveness)
2. ﻿﻿﻿Acknowledges your past mistake (shows growth)
3. ﻿﻿﻿Explains your new approach (secure, non-anxious presence)

And if she seems confused or suspicious about the quiet, you could gently add:
"I used to chase connection out of panic. Now I'm learning to offer it without pressure, to give us both space to feel what's real. But I'm still here. Always."
