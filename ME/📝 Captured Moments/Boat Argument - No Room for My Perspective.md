## Context  
---
While getting the boat into the water, Lori later accused Brennan of forgetting the drain plug and said their boat could’ve sunk if not for her reminder. Brennan remembered the situation differently—he had put the plug in, but had forgotten to remove the rear straps and stopped her before backing in. He gently tried to communicate his version, saying he didn’t want to argue, but remembered it differently.  

Lori responded by asking if he was gaslighting her. Later, she said he was refusing to see her perspective and withdrew into near silence for the rest of the night.  

The broader evening included multiple accusations—saying he was “huffy,” “unobservant,” and not the “partner” she needed. She also expressed frustration with the kids in the same way, saying they didn’t notice things or jump in and help.

## Reflection  
---
Brennan recognized a familiar wound: his perspective being dismissed and replaced by Lori’s memory, without her even asking what *his* version was. He felt invisible and dehumanized, as if he was only valuable when serving, fixing, or apologizing. The shame and anger built up, especially when Lori accused him of being emotionally immature while freezing him out without curiosity.

He also noted that while he didn’t feel angry at first, the repeated accusations and tone escalated his internal state. Eventually, he found himself emotionally checked out and relieved they were driving home separately. He was grateful to pick up the dog from the vet just to have space.

## Notes  
---
- Despite the shutdown, Brennan did *not* fold. He calmly but firmly stated that his memory was different.
- Lori’s behavior likely came from her own internal shame spiral and desire to control a situation that felt overwhelming.
- This is a clear example of “reality invalidation” and emotional blame cycling—where Lori’s distress gets projected outward.
- Brennan also recognized how similar criticism was aimed at the kids that night, helping him see this dynamic is not *only* about him.

## Integration  
---
Brennan wants to track this dynamic as a relational pattern: Lori expressing frustration or pain → projecting it outward with controlling or invalidating language → withdrawing when disagreement arises.  

He is committed to continuing to practice healthy boundary-holding, without collapsing into guilt or self-erasure. He wants to remind himself that **his reality matters**, even when it’s not welcomed.
