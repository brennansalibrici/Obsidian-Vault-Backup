## Context
---
Over the past 24 hours, Brennan and [[Lori Kinney]] were in the middle of an emotionally tender stretch following recent conversations around misalignment, emotional pain, and distance. During a therapy session with [[Dan Schmoyer]], Brennan received a powerful insight: he often talks *at* people — especially Lori — instead of truly *connecting* with them.

Dan helped Brennan identify this pattern by introducing four self-check questions:
- Have I actually connected with the other person, or am I guessing what they need?
- Am I trying to fix or impress someone without being asked?
- Do I have a fantasy story about how I want them to respond?
- Would I feel hurt or resentful if they don’t match that fantasy?

This opened Brennan’s eyes to how deeply ingrained his performance mode has become — especially in emotionally charged moments where he longs for reconnection with Lori.

At the same time, Lori’s guardedness re-emerged — likely driven by fears that Brennan portrayed her unfairly in therapy. While she didn’t say this directly, her tone and timing reflected old emotional defenses, rooted in fear of being misunderstood, judged, or cast as the villain.

## Reflection
---
This landed like a massive internal shift. I realized I’ve been trying to “get it right” with Lori by performing — giving the best answers, showing I’ve done the work, trying to prove my care — but not necessarily giving *myself*. This has likely made Lori feel less safe, not more.

It also helped me understand why I feel exhausted. I’m constantly simulating conversations in my head, creating imagined responses, and pushing toward emotional outcomes that serve a fantasy version of connection rather than real, mutual contact.

Seeing this clearly — especially paired with Lori’s reaction — helped me grieve how often I’ve been unintentionally contributing to the very disconnection I fear. I wasn’t being a villain or a victim… just scared, performing, and stuck.

## Notes
---
- This realization links directly to earlier EMDR prep work around not feeling emotionally received and believing I must "earn" worth through behavior.
- Lori’s guarded tone may be her own fear response — trying to prevent being seen as cruel or dismissive — even if it ironically creates more disconnection.
- This moment may reflect an unspoken emotional rhythm in our relationship: I reach with a performance, she recoils from perceived manipulation or pressure, and the gap widens.
- The fear of being misunderstood *on both sides* feels enormous.
- Emotions felt in this moment: Grieved, Ashamed, Frustrated, Hopeful

## Integration
---
I want to keep these four questions visible in my daily workspace as a grounding tool.  
I want to try speaking to Lori from the present, not from the imagined performance.  
And when she’s withdrawn or skeptical, I want to remember: she might be afraid too.  

This moment isn’t just therapy insight — it’s a doorway. A reorientation.
