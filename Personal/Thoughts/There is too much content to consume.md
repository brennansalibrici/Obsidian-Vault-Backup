![[Example note callout]]

## Context
- [[The 3-Part Daily Routine For Maximum Productivity]]
## Feelings
 - Overwhelm
 - Intrigued
## Thoughts
- There's just too much stuff to learn and take notes about
	- Newsletters
	- All my different interests
	- Books
	- Blogs on medium
	- Tweets
	- YouTube
	- Multipled because of each individual creator

**Did I learn anything?**
- only take notes/consume if I will genuinely use it in the future. Otherwise, I should just bookmark.
## Future Plan
- see above
- make a habit to slowly consume while walking or transitting
- be content with not consuming
