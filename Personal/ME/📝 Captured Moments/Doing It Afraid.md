## Context
---
Sent a calm, emotionally grounded group message to Lori and Hailey about the PSEO application. Even in the midst of silence, anxiety and dread about being criticized or ignored.
## Reflection 
---
I stayed steady. I didn't collapse, chase or get angry. Even though I felt the ache, the fear and the vulnerability, I still offered help and showed up like the man i want to be. This moment matters not because it fixed anything, but because I didn't abandon myself while waiting.
