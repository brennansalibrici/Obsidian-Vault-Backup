## Notes
---
Holding the door open doesn't mean waiting passively or pleading. It means:

1. Consistency without pressure
	- Showing up emotionally available without demanding progress.
	- ﻿﻿Letting her feel your steadiness even if she pulls away.
2. Speaking emotionally, not just logistically
	- ﻿﻿Like you're already doing: talking about your feelings, not just events.
	- ﻿﻿Sharing how you were impacted, so she doesn't have to guess.
3. Respecting her rhythms
	- ﻿﻿Sometimes she'll move closer. Sometimes she'll withdraw.
	- ﻿﻿Your job isn't to chase or analyze every move-it's to stay emotionally grounded and safe either way.
4. Trusting that your presence has value
	- ﻿﻿Even if she doesn't respond the way you hope.
	- ﻿﻿Even if she doesn't "come in" today. Or ever.
	- ﻿﻿It still matters. It still shifts something.
5. Taking care of yourself, too
	- ﻿﻿You can't hold the door if you're collapsing.
	- ﻿﻿Holding the door open includes tending to your own wounds, limits, and truth.
