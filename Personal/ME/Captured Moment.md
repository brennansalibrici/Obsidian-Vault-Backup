UNPROCCESSED NOTE
## Notes
---

## Context
---
I was thinking about how to manage my emotions when they get really big really fast — the kind of moments where pain hits like a high-speed impact and everything in me wants to react or shut down.
## Reflection 
---
I remembered a movie scene where a group of guys had just pulled off a bank robbery. They were in a high-speed chase downtown, but they had a plan. As part of their escape, they turned down a side street and drove full-speed into a shipping container. Their crew was waiting and slammed the doors shut behind them. The cops sped by, completely unaware.

That’s what I want to do with my emotions in those moments.

Not dump them. Not destroy them.

Just get the pain off the streets — lock it in a container where it’s safe and sealed.

Not forever.

Just until the world cools off and I can come back to it with clarity, calm, and care.

This isn’t about hiding. It’s about surviving with dignity and strength.

It’s a planned retreat, not a surrender.

And I’ll come back when I’m ready.

Tagline: Too hot out here. Lock it in the container. We’ll come back when it’s safe.
