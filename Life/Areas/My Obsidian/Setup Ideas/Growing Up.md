How to Grow Up Emotionally—One Moment at a Time

⸻

Step 1: Pause When the Wound Fires

The moment I feel unheard, shut down, invisible, or like I don’t matter—STOP.
Don’t trust the first reaction. That’s 2nd Grade Brennan.
Don’t explain. Don’t fix. Don’t defend.
Just pause—and go to Step 2.

⸻

Step 2: Reparent in Real Time

This isn’t about pushing through—it’s about taking back the wheel.

What TO DO:
	•	Take a breath.
	•	Silently say:
“Okay little guy… I see u. U’re scared and overwhelmed. But I’ve got u now. I’m here.”
	•	Physically ground: Sit up. Plant your feet. Put a hand on your chest.
	•	Keep it simple:
“We’re not alone now. I’m learning. I won’t abandon u.”

Step 3: Shift Into Safe Brennan

Now that I’ve paused and calmed my younger self, I choose how I show up next.

What TO DO:

Use the 3-Part Mirroring Formula:
	1.	Name what she’s feeling
“U sound really hurt.”
	2.	Say why it matters / makes sense
“After everything u’ve carried, of course it would.”
	3.	Let her know it’s safe to share
“U don’t have to hold that alone. I’m here.”

If flooded and can’t mirror yet, say:

“I want to respond like Safe Brennan. I just need a second to find him again.”

⸻

Step 4: Journal the Aftermath

No shame. Just growth. This is where the rewiring happens.

Ask yourself:
	1.	What triggered 2nd Grade Brennan?
	2.	What did Safe Brennan try to do—even a little?
	3.	What can I do 1% better next time?

Even if you failed, this step builds muscle. Every rep counts.

⸻

Step 5: Practice the Reps on the Calm Days

Emotional maturity is built before the storm.

What TO DO:
	•	Reflect daily: “What did Safe Brennan do today?”
	•	Celebrate small wins: “I caught the spiral before it started.”
	•	Use peaceful moments to practice validation and grounding—even in tiny ways.

Safe Brennan isn’t built by force.
He’s built by consistency, compassion, and courage.
