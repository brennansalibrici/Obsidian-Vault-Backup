## Listing Items for Sale on Each Platform
---
<u>eBay:</u> Creating a listing on eBay can be done via the website or mobile app. You’ll provide a title, description, category, condition, price, and at least one photo (up to 12 photos free). eBay allows both fixed-price “Buy It Now” listings and auction-style listings. You also set shipping options (who pays shipping and which carrier/service you will use) and a handling time. Once you fill in all details and set the price (or starting bid), you can publish the listing. eBay may charge an _insertion fee_ for listing an item beyond monthly free quotas (more on fees later), but new sellers usually get some free listings [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360032716413-How-do-I-list-an-item#:~:text=To%20list%20on%20the%20app%2C,just%20follow%20these%20steps) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360032716413-How-do-I-list-an-item#:~:text=,Tap%20%27post%20listing). Listings on eBay can be set to duration (for auctions or fixed price) or “Good ‘Til Cancelled” which auto-renews each month. Keep in mind that both active listings and any that sell will count toward your monthly selling limit on a new account [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%27ll%20review%20your%20account%20every,listings%20count%20toward%C2%A0your%20monthly%20limit) (explained in the next section).

<u>Depop:</u> Depop is a mobile-focused platform (though it also has a desktop site) popular for trendy and vintage fashion. To list on Depop, use the app or website and tap the “Sell” button. You can add up to 4 photos and 1 short video of your item [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360032716413-How-do-I-list-an-item#:~:text=,Tap%20%27post%20listing). You’ll write a description and can include up to 5 hashtags (and 2 brand-specific hashtags) to improve discoverability [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360032716413-How-do-I-list-an-item#:~:text=,Tap%20%27post%20listing). Select an appropriate category for the item (e.g. Men’s Tops, Women’s Shoes, etc.), set your price, and choose a shipping method (Depop shipping label or shipping on your own). Once you post, the listing is live in your Depop shop feed. Depop does not charge a fee to list, but will charge a percentage fee when the item sells (covered in Fees section). There is no explicit limit on how many items you can list on Depop as a new seller - you can list as many items as you have inventory, as long as they comply with Depop’s policies.

<u>Poshmark:</u> Poshmark is focused on fashion and related items. To list an item, use the app’s “Sell” button (or the desktop “Sell on Poshmark” form). You’ll upload photos (Poshmark allows up to 16 photos per listing), add a description, and fill out fields like title, category, brand, size, color, etc. You must also set an Original Price (retail value, for reference) and your Listing Price (the price you want to sell for). Poshmark does not charge per listing and encourages sellers to list frequently to keep their “closets” active. Like Depop, Poshmark has no hard limit on listing quantity; many sellers have hundreds or even thousands of active listings. All listings are “Buy It Now” style (no auctions), and prices are negotiable via offers. Once listed, your item is visible in the marketplace and your followers’ feeds.

## Selling Limits
---
Each platform handles new seller limits and tiered seller statuses differently. It’s important to know if there are quantity limits or performance tiers and what it takes to advance.

### eBay Selling Limits for New Sellers
<u>Quantity & Value Limits:</u> eBay places strict selling limits on new sellers to ensure they can handle orders and to prevent fraud. A brand-new eBay account is typically limited to 10 items or $500 in sales in the first month [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=The%20selling%20limits%20affect%20you,a%20total%20value%20of%20%24500) [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=As%20a%20new%20seller%2C%20you%E2%80%99re,to%20a%20maximum%20of%20%24500). This means you can list up to 10 items (or fewer if their combined price exceeds $500) in a month. Both active listings and sold items count toward this monthly limit, while unsold listings that expire without selling do _not_ count [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=There%20are%20limits%20on%20the,apply%20on%20a%20monthly%20basis)[repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=As%20a%20new%20seller%2C%20you%E2%80%99re,to%20a%20maximum%20of%20%24500). For example, if you list 10 items and 5 sell, you’ve hit the limit; if some don’t sell and end, you could relist unsold ones or list new items up to the limit. These initial limits are in place indefinitely until eBay increases them - typically eBay will review your account every 30 days and may raise your limit automatically if you have good sales and feedback [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%27ll%20review%20your%20account%20every,listings%20count%20toward%C2%A0your%20monthly%20limit) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=your%20active%20and%20sold%20listings,count%20toward%C2%A0your%20monthly%20limit). You can also manually request a higher limit after a month of selling, and eBay may ask for additional verification when you do [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=If%20your%20selling%20performance%20and,in%20new%20window%20or%20tab)  ([Request Higher Limit Link](https://www.ebay.com/help/action?topicId=4107&af=2)).

<u>Category Limits:</u> In addition to account-wide limits, eBay may impose category-specific limits if you are new to selling in certain categories (for instance, high-risk categories like gift cards, electronics, or luxury goods) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=Category%20limits). These category limits are to ensure you become familiar with category-specific rules. Once you have a track record and meet the criteria, most category limits will be lifted automatically [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20new%20to%20selling,may%20apply%20in%20that%20category). If you hit a category limit, <u>DON'T</u> try to list the item under a wrong category to bypass it - that violates eBay policy [eBay Manipulation Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=categories%20you%20list%20in).

<u>How long do limits last?</u> The base selling limit (e.g. 10 items/$500) is typically for the first month. As you demonstrate successful sales and good customer service, eBay will raise your limits - often to 25 items/$1,500, then 100/$5,000, and so on (each case may vary). These increases can happen monthly. If you need more, you can request a limit increase manually once every 30 days. Generally, within 90 days many sellers see an automatic increase if they’ve met buyer demand well [export.ebay.com](https://export.ebay.com/en/first-steps/rules-and-restrictions-in-selling/selling-limits/#:~:text=Selling%20limits%20,Remember%2C). There is no fixed timeline; it depends on your performance and sales volume. The key point is that eBay’s limits gradually ease as you prove yourself, and there is no upper limit after you’ve built a solid selling history - it becomes practically unlimited for established sellers.

### Depop and Poshmark Listing Limits
<u>Depop:</u> Depop does _not impose formal selling quantity limits on new sellers_. You can list as many items as you want. However, Depop accounts that scale up very fast might get flagged for review to ensure no policy violations, but there’s no published numeric limit. The main “limits” on Depop relate not to quantity, but to performance if you aim for their Top Seller program (covered in Seller Tiers below). Otherwise, any active user can list freely in allowed categories. Just ensure you abide by Depop’s community guidelines and verify your account (Depop may require phone or email verification for new accounts).

<u>Poshmark:</u> Similarly, Poshmark has _no set limit on listings or sales for new users_. You could list dozens or hundreds of items as soon as you start. In fact, having at least 50 available listings is one criterion to become a Poshmark Ambassador (a status discussed shortly) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=To%20become%20a%20PM%20Ambassador,have%20to%20meet%20these%20criteria), which implies Poshmark encourages sellers to build a sizable “closet.” Poshmark’s focus is more on community engagement and reputation rather than limiting how much you can sell initially. That said, new sellers’ listings might not get as much visibility until they participate actively (sharing items, following others), but there is no artificial cap on your selling other than the types of items allowed on the platform.

#### Selling Limits

| Platform     | Initial Account Limits          | Category Limits                               | Timeline for Increases                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eBay     | 10 items / $500 per month (new) | Certain categories restricted for new sellers | Reviewed every 30 days; limits may increase within 90 days if good metrics maintained |
| Depop    | No explicit selling limits      | N/A                                           | No limits imposed; growth based on performance                                        |
| Poshmark | No listing limits               | N/A                                           | No limits imposed; seller encouraged to increase activity                             |

## Seller Status Levels and Tiers
---
Each platform has programs or tiers for sellers based on experience and performance. These often come with benefits:

### eBay Seller Levels:
eBay evaluates sellers on the 20th of each month and assigns a seller level: _Top Rated_, _Above Standard_, or _Below Standard_. All new sellers start with no special status (effectively “Above Standard” if they have no issues). Over time, you can become a Top Rated Seller if you meet specific performance criteria. To qualify as Top Rated, you must have _at least 100 sales and $1,000 in sales in the past 12 months, an active account for 90+ days, and excellent performance metrics_ [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Seller%20performance%20evaluation) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,with%20eBay%27s%20Selling%20practices%20policy). The performance metrics include keeping your defect rate (cases you didn’t resolve or order cancellations) under 0.5%, cases of unresolved buyer issues under 0.3% (or no more than 2 cases), and your late shipment rate under 3% [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Top%20Rated%20seller%20requirements). You also need to upload tracking on at least 95% of transactions on time [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,time%20and%20validated%20by%20carrier). If you meet all the criteria in a monthly evaluation, eBay automatically upgrades you to Top Rated status by the next evaluation cycle (typically on the 20th, with status effective the following month) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=To%20become%20a%20Top%20Rated,complying%20with%20other%20eBay%20policies) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=We%27ll%20automatically%20upgrade%20you%20to,at%20your%20seller%20performance%20evaluation).

- _Top Rated Seller Benefits:_ Being Top Rated gives you a badge on your profile (visible to buyers) and access to a program called "Top Rated Plus" [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=eBay%20Top%20Rated%20Plus%20requirements,and%20benefits). If as a Top Rated Seller you offer 1-day handling and 30-day (or longer) free returns on an item, that listing earns a “Top Rated Plus” seal and you get a 10% discount on final value fees for that sale [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=eBay%20Top%20Rated%20Plus%20requirements,and%20benefits). Top Rated sellers also supposedly get improved search placement and some seller protection benefits (for example, eBay may remove negative feedback in certain circumstances if you are Top Rated and did everything right). Note that if you fall below the standards, you can lose Top Rated status at the next evaluation - but once you become Top Rated, maintaining it simply means continuing to hit the required metrics. There isn’t a higher tier beyond Top Rated; eBay did have a legacy “PowerSeller” program, but that is essentially replaced by Top Rated (PowerSeller is now just a sign of consistent sales volume, without extra perks).

- _Above Standard:_ This is the default level assigned to most sellers who meet eBay’s basic performance standards. It means the seller is not Top Rated but also not performing poorly enough to be considered Below Standard. Sellers at this level typically have acceptable defect rates and on-time shipping, but without the volume or excellence needed for Top Rated benefits.

- _Below Standard:_ If a seller’s performance falls below eBay’s minimum requirements (exceeding defect rate limits or too many cases closed against you), eBay will mark the account Below Standard. This has serious consequences: eBay may restrict your selling (lower search visibility, selling limit reductions) and charge additional fees as a penalty [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,fees%2C%20until%20your%20performance%20improves) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,fees%2C%20until%20your%20performance%20improves). Specifically, eBay policy states that falling Below Standard can result in a surcharge of 5% on final value fees for sellers in that status [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,fees%2C%20until%20your%20performance%20improves). eBay will warn you if you are at risk. It’s crucial to address issues (like unresolved cases or order defects) quickly to avoid or recover from Below Standard. Seller level evaluations look at either the last 3 months or 12 months of performance (if you had fewer than 400 sales in 3 months, they look back 12 months) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=On%20the%2020th%20of%20each,transactions%20to%20work%20out%20your) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,from%20the%20last%2012%20months). So a rough patch can be fixed over time by improving your service going forward.

### Poshmark Seller Tiers:
Poshmark doesn’t have “levels” based on metrics in the same way, but they do have the Posh Ambassador program which is a milestone and status for active, experienced sellers. There are two levels: Posh Ambassador I and Posh Ambassador II.

- _Posh Ambassador I:_ To achieve this, you must complete a set of tasks that demonstrate you are an engaged and successful community member. The requirements include: having at least 50 available listings, making at least 15 sales, sharing 5,000 items from other closets (community shares) and 5,000 self-shares of your own items, giving at least one _Love Note_ (a positive review) to a seller, maintaining an average rating of at least 4.5 out of 5, and an average ship time under 3 days [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Requirement%20Category%20Specific%20Goal%20Community,for) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=,items%20from%20other%20Poshers%E2%80%99%20closets). There’s no time limit to achieve these; once you hit all the targets, Poshmark will invite you to become a Posh Ambassador.

- _Posh Ambassador II:_ Introduced in 2022, this is a higher status with additional requirements. To qualify, you need to have been a PA I for at least 6 consecutive months, plus meet yearly criteria: 20,000 community shares, 100 available listings, 50 listings sold, recruit 1 new person to join Poshmark, and maintain a 4.7+ rating and <3 day ship time [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=,a%20Posh%20Ambassador) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=). These are more intensive engagement and sales metrics. Once you meet those, you’re granted PA II status.

- _Benefits:_ Posh Ambassadors (I) get a badge on their profile and are recommended to new users as closets to follow [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Increased%20Closet%20Visibility%20and%20Followers) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Requirement%20Category%20Specific%20Goal%20Community,for). This means new Poshmark users will see PA closets suggested, giving you more followers and potential buyers. Ambassadors also receive an exclusive newsletter (Posh Insider) with tips and occasionally early access opportunities (like early bird access to event tickets) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Exclusive%20Newsletter%20and%20Perks) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=And%20I%E2%80%99ll%20take%20any%20insightful,on%20sale%20to%20the%20public). Posh Ambassador II comes with a new badge and even better perks: priority support (faster customer service responses), possible tickets to Poshmark events, global promotion in the app, and invites to exclusive programs or events [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=,badge) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=). Importantly, PA status does not give fee discounts (Poshmark’s fee is flat for all sellers) - it’s more about visibility and community standing.

- _Maintaining Status:_ Once you’re a Posh Ambassador I, you do not have to continuously meet those entry stats - it’s a one-time achievement [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20maintain%20Poshmark,Ambassador%20I%20status). Even if your active listings dip below 50 later or you slow down sharing, you retain the PA I badge. For PA II, however, there are maintenance requirements each quarter to remain at that level (such as creating a certain number of listings every quarter, etc., as per Poshmark’s guidelines) [frompenniestoplenty.com](https://www.frompenniestoplenty.com/blog/poshmark-ambassador-benefits#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20maintain%20Poshmark,Ambassador%20II%20status). Poshmark will inform PA II’s of the upkeep needed, which ensures those with the status stay active on the platform.

### Depop Top Seller Program: 
Depop doesn’t have tiered levels for all sellers, but it runs an invite-only Top Seller program that functions similarly to a “power seller” status. Top Seller isn’t automatic; you must meet criteria and then Depop invites you to the program. The requirements (as of Depop’s guidelines) are to achieve certain goals consistently for 4 consecutive months [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=How%20to%20Become%20a%20Top,Seller%20on%20Depop):
- Earn at least $1,000 in sales each month (before fees) [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=1,1%2C000%20per%20month%20on%20Depop).
- Maintain an average rating of 4.5 stars or higher from your buyers [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=1,1%2C000%20per%20month%20on%20Depop).
- Ship 90% of your orders within 5 days of purchase (i.e. prompt shipping) [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=via%20email%29).
- Have no infractions or policy violations on your account (e.g. no banned items, no significant cancelation rate or spam reports) [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=3,by%20team%20Depop%20via%20email).
- Keep a low refund rate (below 5%), meaning very few of your orders result in refunds/returns [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=via%20email%29).

You need to hit all those metrics each month over a 4-month period. In practice, it actually takes 5 months: you qualify by month 1’s end, then maintain through month 4, and then you get the status in month 5 [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=Becoming%20a%20Depop%20seller%20is,month%20for%20four%20consecutive%20months).

The program essentially rewards consistent high performers with perks that help them scale further.

> [!info]
> eBay’s tiers are mainly about performance standards (with Top Rated Seller offering tangible fee discounts), Poshmark’s Ambassador program is about community activity and grants visibility perks, and Depop’s Top Seller is about sustained high sales and reliability, granting marketing and support benefits. For a new reseller, these are longer-term goals - initially focus on meeting any selling limits and providing good service, and these statuses will come in time as you grow.

## Category Restrictions and Prohibited Items
---
All three platforms have rules about what you can sell. It’s crucial to follow these to avoid getting listings removed or your account penalized. Below is outlined what categories or items are _not allowed_ or restricted on each platform:

### eBay:
<u>Prohibited and Restricted Items:</u> eBay is a broad marketplace, but it has an extensive list of prohibited or regulated items. Key prohibited items include: illegal drugs, weapons (firearms and certain knives), explosives, hazardous materials, stolen goods, child pornography or inappropriate adult materials, live animals (with limited exceptions), and counterfeit items or replicas (fake designer goods) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=Illegal%20Items%2C%20Fakes%2C%20and%20Replicas). eBay also restricts the sale of alcohol and tobacco (some collectibles or empty containers may be allowed with conditions), and completely prohibits prescription medications and medical devices that aren’t FDA-approved for over-the-counter sale. Certain cosmetics and health items (like used cosmetics) are not allowed. Additionally, eBay forbids items that promote hate or violence and items from protected species (e.g. ivory, certain furs) per international law [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=Beyond%20fakes%2C%20this%20category%20also,animal%20furs%20on%20the%20platform) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=Beyond%20fakes%2C%20this%20category%20also,animal%20furs%20on%20the%20platform).

<u>Category-specific policies:</u> For example, selling gift cards is allowed but with limits on value, event tickets may have resale restrictions by region, and electronics like cell phones may have carrier-lock status disclosure requirements. Another noteworthy rule: you cannot sell counterfeit or “replica” fashion items - selling fakes can lead to a ban. Make sure any branded items are authentic and be ready to prove authenticity for high-end luxury goods (buyers can use eBay’s authenticity guarantee service in some categories).

### Poshmark:
<u>Prohibited Items:</u> Poshmark is primarily for fashion, so it only allows certain categories: clothing, accessories, beauty products (new only), select home decor, select pet items, and small electronics. Poshmark explicitly prohibits items outside these realms. For example, no appliances, no used electronics like DVDs or video games (they have a limited Electronics Market for things like headphones or smartwatches, but large electronics are not allowed) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=match%20at%20L309%20Unsupported%20Electronics,Electronics%20Market). Other prohibited items on Poshmark include:
- Illegal items or counterfeit goods: Just like eBay, Poshmark bans replicas/fakes and anything illegal [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=Illegal%20Items%2C%20Fakes%2C%20and%20Replicas).
- Health and wellness products: Poshmark does not allow supplements, vitamins, diet pills, medical devices, or any item with a medical claim [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=). Even something like an N95 mask (which implies a medical claim) was cited as not allowed [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=).
- Certain beauty products: While Poshmark expanded into beauty, they only allow certain items. Nail polish, perfumes, aerosols, and any pressurized or alcohol-based fragrance are generally _not supported_ [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=claims) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=According%20to%20Poshmark%27s%20policies%2C%20items,primary%20reason%20for%20the%20restriction) because they are hazardous to ship. Poshmark’s rule is that any permitted fragrance must be new, alcohol-free, and aerosol-free [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=According%20to%20Poshmark%27s%20policies%2C%20items,primary%20reason%20for%20the%20restriction) - which effectively disqualifies most perfumes. Also, used makeup or skincare is not allowed for hygiene reasons (only new, swatch-free cosmetics are allowed).
- Used undergarments: Poshmark forbids sale of used underwear or used swimsuits without hygienic liners. Specifically, used underwear and bodysuits are unsupported [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=match%20at%20L210%20The%20guidelines,their%20condition%20in%20your%20listing). New underwear (with tags) is fine, but anything that’s obviously personal/hygiene related and used is banned.
- Flammable or hazardous items: No fireworks, no weapons. Even knives are mostly not allowed, except maybe table knives. weapon accessories are also banned [scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/745779050/prohibited-items-policy-2-0-Poshmark#:~:text=Prohibited,not%20allowed%2C%20nor%20are).
- Live animals or products from endangered species: Like others, no ivory, no taxidermy of protected species, etc.
- Non-fashion items: Things like furniture, appliances, cars, real estate, etc., are not allowed on Poshmark, since it’s not a general marketplace.

<u>Category Rules:</u> Poshmark focuses on fashion, home decor, and beauty - anything outside that scope or unsafe is prohibited. If you try to list disallowed items, Poshmark will usually delete the listing and could issue a warning. Repeated violations risk account suspension. Always check Poshmark’s official Prohibited Items Policy for specifics (available on their website) [poshmark.com](https://poshmark.com/privacy?srsltid=AfmBOooq5QPm_Q6rXHa140HH03lPRFrHDHv5y86Ivm_SBWBFqEB-Vjsl#:~:text=Terms%20of%20Service%20,).

### Depop:
<u>Prohibited Items:</u> Depop’s user base is younger and the platform also centers on fashion/vintage, but they do allow some broader lifestyle items (art, books, some electronics). However, Depop likewise bans a range of items:
- Illegal and regulated goods: No drugs, no weapons/firearms, no stolen property, no illicit items. This includes prescription drugs, supplements, or anything requiring a prescription.
- Counterfeit and trademark-infringing items: Depop has zero tolerance for fakes. Selling knock-off designer goods can get you banned.
- Offensive materials: Anything promoting hate speech or extreme violence is forbidden.
- Animals or wildlife products: Depop doesn’t allow sale of live animals. Items like ivory, shells from endangered species, or fur from endangered species are not allowed.
- Hazardous items: No fireworks, explosives, or anything that can’t be shipped legally.
- Body fluids or used intimate items: Obvious no-go’s (though Depop’s audience likely wouldn’t list those anyway).
- Electronics and other categories: Depop does allow electronics in some capacity (e.g., vintage video games, used phones) but they must be honestly represented. There isn’t a strict ban like Poshmark’s on electronics, but sellers should ensure items work and are as described to avoid claims. Depop’s focus is still fashion/streetwear, art, and music merchandise, etc., so very large items or non-ship-friendly items wouldn’t be practical and could be removed.

<u>Category Limits:</u> Aside from outright banned items, Depop doesn’t have special category limits for new sellers. Just ensure you list in the correct category for visibility (mis-categorizing could get your listing removed for “search manipulation”). eBay’s category limits we discussed earlier (e.g. a new seller might be limited in selling say _Collectible Coins_ until they establish history). Poshmark doesn’t really have category _limits_, but note they only recently allowed electronics in a limited way: Poshmark’s “electronics” are mostly personal tech like headphones, smartwatches, and only certain conditions. Listing a random kitchen microwave on Poshmark would likely be removed as it’s outside their supported categories [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-s-prohibited-items-list-what-you-can-t-sell/#:~:text=Unsupported%20Electronics%20%26%20Goods%20Cell,Electronics%20Market).

## What Exactly Is a “Listing”?
---
### eBay:
Active vs. Sold Listings (eBay): On eBay, your monthly selling limit counts both the listings currently active for sale _and_ any that have sold within that month [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%27ll%20review%20your%20account%20every,listings%20count%20toward%C2%A0your%20monthly%20limit). For example, if you have a limit of 10 items per month and you list 10 and sell 5, you cannot list additional items that month even though 5 are no longer available - you’ve used all 10 slots in that period. Unsold listings that end without a sale do _not_ count against the limit after they end [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=There%20are%20limits%20on%20the,apply%20on%20a%20monthly%20basis) [repricer.com](https://www.repricer.com/blog/ebay-selling-limits/#:~:text=As%20a%20new%20seller%2C%20you%E2%80%99re,to%20a%20maximum%20of%20%24500). The counter resets each month when the allowance renews (or increases). Also, fixed-price Good-’Til-Cancelled listings that renew each month will count each renewal as a new listing in terms of limits and insertion fees [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%20may%20end%20any%20listings,amount%20that%20you%20can%20sell). This is why eBay says if you’re at your max, the GTC listings won’t auto-renew until you have room [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%20may%20end%20any%20listings,amount%20that%20you%20can%20sell).

### Poshmark:
Poshmark considers a listing as any active item in your closet that’s available for sale. Sold listings move into your closet’s sold section and are not counted as active. Poshmark doesn’t limit your number of active listings, nor do they charge per listing, so there isn’t much confusion - everything you have for sale is just listed in your closet. Do note, however, that Poshmark does not automatically remove a listing when it sells on another platform (if you cross-post). You have to manually mark it as not for sale. There is no monthly “quota” or renewal; listings stay until you delete them or they sell. Poshmark also allows multi-quantity listings (e.g. if you have 3 identical shirts, you can list them under one listing with quantity 3). Those count as one listing in your closet count.

### Depop:
Depop Listings: Depop also treats each item for sale as a listing, and once it’s sold, it will be marked sold and not shown as available. Depop has no listing cap, and listings don’t expire - they remain until sold or removed. If you have a quantity of an item, Depop doesn’t have a built-in multi-quantity feature like eBay; typically on Depop it’s one item per listing (it’s a very peer-to-peer model). So if you have 5 identical shirts, you’d need to create 5 separate listings or relist after each sale. Depop counts only active listings in your shop count. Like Poshmark, if you sell an item off-platform, you need to delete it manually to avoid accidental double-selling.

<u>Listings and Fees:</u> eBay is unique in charging potential fees per listing beyond a free allotment (if you exceed free listings, you pay insertion fees). Poshmark and Depop have no listing fees. So “listing” count matters for eBay’s billing - e.g., if you have a personal account with 250 free listings per month, only active listings (or new listings created) count against that. Ended or sold listings no longer count once they’ve ended, but each distinct listing creation is an event. If you relist an item, that’s a new listing in terms of count. For Depop/Posh, you don’t pay per listing, so the definition is more about what’s for sale vs sold.

> [!info] 
> eBay’s concept of listings is tied to both selling limits and fee calculations (active + sold in a period count) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=We%27ll%20review%20your%20account%20every,listings%20count%20toward%C2%A0your%20monthly%20limit), whereas Poshmark and Depop are simpler with unlimited free listings and only active ones being relevant at a given time.

## Seller Performance Metrics and Standards
---
All platforms care about seller performance to ensure buyers have a good experience. However, eBay has the most formal metrics and “report card” for sellers. 

### eBay:
- <u>Transaction Defect Rate (TDR):</u> This is the percentage of your orders that had a serious problem. Specifically, eBay counts a “defect” if you cancel an order because you’re out of stock _or_ if a case is closed by eBay because you didn’t resolve a buyer issue [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=What%20this%20means) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=We%20count%20a%20transaction%20defect,either%20of%20these%20things%20happen). Essentially, item not received or not as described cases that you don’t make right count as defects, as do cancellations for stockouts. eBay’s minimum standard is to keep defects under 2% of transactions (and you won’t be considered Below Standard unless those defects come from at least 5 different buyers) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Minimum%20requirements) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=You%27re%20allowed%20up%20to%202,defects%20within%20an%20evaluation%20period). Top Rated status is tougher - you need defect rate no more than 0.5% with at most 3 defect instances [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Seller%20performance%20evaluation). This metric is refreshed with each evaluation, looking at either your last 3 months or 12 months of sales depending on volume [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=On%20the%2020th%20of%20each,transactions%20to%20work%20out%20your).

- <u>Late Shipment Rate:</u> This measures how often you ship items past the handling time and expected delivery date. eBay calculates this by tracking scans: an item is “late” if it either doesn’t get a carrier scan within your stated handling time _or_ if delivery is confirmed after the latest estimated delivery date [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=We%20help%20set%20buyers%27%20expectations,service%20selected%20by%20the%20buyer) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=With%20tracking%2C%20we%27ll%20count%20an,item%20as%20late%20when). If no tracking, eBay will ask the buyer if the item arrived on time and count a late if the buyer says it was late [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=If%20there%20is%20no%20tracking,information%20available). For performance standards, eBay actually has _no hard minimum requirement_ for late shipment to avoid Below Standard [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Late%20shipment%20rate) - meaning you won’t be Below Standard solely due to late shipping. However, to be Top Rated you must keep late shipments under 3% (or no more than 5 late transactions if you had under 100 sales) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,transaction%20have%20tracking%20uploaded%20within). It’s refreshed on each evaluation. As a seller, it’s good to keep this low because late shipments can still affect buyer satisfaction and feedback.

- <u> Cases Closed Without Seller Resolution:</u> This refers to disputes (item not received or return requests) where eBay had to step in and found in favor of the buyer because the seller didn’t resolve it. eBay expects sellers to resolve issues or accept returns when appropriate. You are allowed up to 2 such cases in an evaluation period or 0.3% of transactions, whichever is higher [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=Minimum%20requirements) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=You%27re%20allowed%202%20cases%20closed,transactions%20%E2%80%93%20whichever%20is%20higher). More than that, and you’ll be Below Standard. This is essentially counted within defect rate as well, but eBay also caps it separately (since just 1 or 2 cases can be enough if you have very few sales).

- <u>Tracking Upload Rate:</u> eBay tracks if you upload valid tracking numbers on time. For Top Rated eligibility, you need tracking uploaded within your handling time for at least 95% of transactions [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,time%20and%20validated%20by%20carrier). This shows you consistently provide tracking info promptly. It’s not a factor for Below Standard, but it’s needed for Top Rated status.

- <u>Look-Back Period:</u> (on the 20th of the month [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=How%20we%20calculate%20your%20seller,level))
	- Recent transactions > 400, 3 month look-back period
	- Recent transactions < 400, 12 month look-back period

- <u>Refresh Rate:</u> These metrics are updated continuously but formally “refresh” in your dashboard after each monthly evaluation. You can check your Seller Dashboard anytime to see where you stand [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107#:~:text=You%20can%20always%20find%20your,limit%20in%20Seller%20Hub%3B%C2%A0here%27s%20how). The metrics consider a window of either 3 or 12 months as mentioned. For new sellers, eBay gives a bit of grace - they might evaluate over 12 months if your volume is low, meaning one defect early on won’t immediately tank you if you have under 400 sales in 3 months [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,from%20the%20last%2012%20months). Metrics are calculated continuously but formal evaluations occur on the 20th of each month for seller level changes [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=What%20happens%20if%20you%20are,Below%20Standard). If you improve your metrics, you’ll see the effect at the next evaluation (or possibly mid-cycle in your dashboard projections). Some metrics like late shipment rate and tracking upload are rolling calculations updated as you upload tracking or as packages get delivered.

### Poshmark:
- <u>Average Rating:</u> After a sale, buyers can rate the transaction 1-5 stars and leave an optional “Love Note” (comment) if it’s 5 stars. Your profile shows an average star rating (out of 5) to one decimal place. New sellers won’t have this until a few sales. This average is across your last X number of ratings (Poshmark hasn’t publicly stated if it’s lifetime or last 100 - likely it’s lifetime average). Having a high average (e.g. 4.9) makes you look reliable. Posh Ambassador requires at least 4.5 average, as noted [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Available%20Listings%20Have%20at%20least,for).

- <u>Ship Time:</u> Poshmark displays your average ship time on your profile (e.g. “Ships in 2 Days on Average”). This is calculated based on the time from sale to you shipping (when you scan the label). Poshmark encourages shipping within 1-3 days. An average under 3 days is needed for Posh Ambassador status [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Available%20Listings%20Have%20at%20least,for). If you often ship same-day or next-day, you might see “Ships in 1 Day” which is attractive to buyers. Conversely, if you delay shipping, buyers might see “Ships in 5 Days” which could deter sales. Poshmark does not explicitly punish you for slow shipping (aside from possibly losing Ambassador eligibility), but if you exceed 7 days without shipping, the order can be canceled by Poshmark and that could affect your standing (and certainly disappoint the buyer).

- <u>Cancellation Rate:</u> This isn’t publicly shown, but if you cancel too many orders (especially if you as the seller cancel because you can’t find the item or it’s not available), Poshmark may flag your account. While Poshmark hasn’t stated a threshold, an anecdotal best practice is to keep seller-initiated cancellations low (under a few percent of your sales). Frequent cancellations or not shipping can lead to temporary restrictions on your account or a warning. Poshmark wants sellers to fulfill orders.

- <u>Returns/Complaints:</u> Poshmark’s policy is “all sales are final” unless an item is not as described. If buyers open _cases_ (disputes) for misrepresentation and Poshmark sides with them often, that could hurt your reputation with Poshmark’s team. There’s no publicly visible metric, but Poshmark may take action against sellers who repeatedly have issues (like items often “not as described” or counterfeit claims). Generally, keeping buyers happy (accurate listings, quick shipping) is the goal. Poshmark doesn’t have an equivalent to Top Rated seller, so the incentive is mainly maintaining good ratings to encourage more sales and possibly to reach Ambassador statuses.

- <u>Look-Back Period:</u> Rolling past 90 days 

- <u>Refresh Rate:</u> Rating and ship time update with every new sale’s feedback. It’s a rolling figure. Posh Ambassador status eligibility is checked in real-time; once you meet all criteria, you can get the status immediately. Posh Ambassador II is reviewed periodically (annually for criteria and quarterly for maintenance). There’s no monthly “evaluation” day; it’s ongoing.

### Depop
- <u>Seller Rating:</u> Depop buyers can rate transactions 1-5 stars (via Depop’s review system after a purchase). Your profile shows your average star rating (e.g. 5.0, 4.8) and the number of reviews. Maintaining a high rating is crucial, as many buyers consider this, and it’s also required for Top Seller (minimum 4.5) [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=1,1%2C000%20per%20month%20on%20Depop).

- <u>Seller “Score” and Badges</u>: Depop used to display a “Recommended” badge or verify certain accounts. As of now, aside from Top Seller verification, there’s not a multi-tier public score. But Depop’s algorithm likely boosts listings from sellers who ship on time and have good feedback (though not officially confirmed). They do explicitly track if you ship within 3 days as part of good practice, and we know for Top Sellers they measure shipping within 5 days 90% of the time [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=via%20email%29).

- <u>Infractions:</u> Depop keeps track of any policy violations on your account (e.g., if you listed a banned item and they removed it, or if you had an unusual number of refunds). Depop refers to these as “infringements” or strikes. Too many can get you suspended. Also, if you often cancel orders or don’t ship, those count as infractions in Depop’s eyes. One metric for Top Seller is _no infringements_ - meaning a clean record [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=3,by%20team%20Depop%20via%20email).

- <u>Customer Service Metrics:</u> Depop doesn’t publicly show a late shipment metric or cancellation rate, but Depop Protection (their buyer protection) will refund buyers if something goes wrong. If as a seller you have multiple cases of items not arriving or being “significantly not as described,” Depop may step in with warnings or suspension. They do have an internal metric of “refund rate” which Top Sellers must keep below 5% [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=via%20email%29). This implies they calculate what percentage of your orders are refunded (which would mostly be due to items not received or buyer disputes resolved against you). Even if you’re not aiming for Top Seller, keeping that low is important: a high refund rate could trigger account review.

- <u>Look-Back Period:</u> Past 4 months of activity

- <u>Refresh Rate:</u> Your rating updates with each review. The Top Seller criteria are checked monthly, but since it’s invite-only, presumably Depop’s team reviews accounts that hit the numbers each month or two. If you meet the monthly targets, after 4 months you’re invited - so in that sense, every month’s performance matters. Depop’s app also has a Seller Statistics section where you can see your sales, number of sold items, etc., which is updated in real time. They even allow sellers to see their progress toward Top Seller metrics on the web dashboard (for example, you might see metrics like current month sales total, etc. - Depop announced some analytics tools).

## Shipping and Fulfillment Rules
---
### Who Chooses the Shipping Method?
- <u>eBay:</u> On eBay, the seller sets the shipping options when creating the listing. You decide which carrier and service you will use (e.g., USPS Priority Mail, UPS Ground, etc.) and whether you charge the buyer for shipping or offer “free shipping” (where you bake the cost into price). Buyers at checkout will only see the options you provided. In some cases, you might offer multiple options (say standard vs expedited), and the buyer picks one. But generally, the carrier is decided by what you advertised. Once the item is sold, it’s the seller’s job to purchase postage (you can buy a label through eBay at a discounted commercial rate or buy elsewhere) and ship with the promised carrier. If you listed USPS, for example, you should ship via USPS to meet the estimated delivery. Sellers have flexibility to use a different carrier if needed (for instance, you might upgrade to UPS if it’s faster) but if you do, you must ensure it doesn’t delay delivery and you provide the tracking. It’s safest to stick with what was offered. eBay doesn’t mandate a specific carrier - it’s your choice, but once the buyer pays, you _must_ ship in a way that meets the listing’s shipping time frame and you have to provide tracking.

- <u>Depop:</u> Depop offers two shipping methods to sellers in the US: Depop Shipping (prepaid label) or Shipping on your Own. If you choose Depop’s shipping, Depop will generate a USPS shipping label for you once your item sells [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=Get%20your%20shipping%20label). (Depop partners with USPS for most U.S. labels, using services like USPS Ground Advantage for light packages or Priority Mail for heavier). In some regions Depop also offers UPS, but in the US context, USPS is standard [rollo.com](https://www.rollo.com/blog/depop-shipping-secrets-for-fast-budget-shipping/?srsltid=AfmBOorWRGZZXCDW6Wkxg3stfs6U10zD0e-WM85poVqqMlv72AvF0BKw#:~:text=Depop%20Shipping%3A%20Secrets%20for%20Fast,more%20economical%20for%20smaller%2C) [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/depop-shipping-how-does-shipping-work-on-depop#:~:text=Blog%20blog,FedEx%20can%20help%20you). So effectively, if you opt in, Depop decides the carrier (USPS) and service level based on item weight. If instead you choose to ship on your own (“Other”), then it’s up to you which carrier to use - many Depop sellers use USPS or UPS through a third-party shipping service like PirateShip. In that case, you arrange and pay postage yourself, and you must provide the tracking number on the app after shipment [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20your%20shipping%20method%20is,set%20to%20%E2%80%98Other%E2%80%99) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20you%20choose%20this%20method%2C,the%20buyer%20will%20be%20refunded). Buyers on Depop pay a separate shipping fee at purchase (unless you offered free shipping), so they don’t choose the carrier - it’s either the Depop label (always USPS) or whatever you, the seller, choose if using your own method. Do note: If you select Depop’s label and then don’t use it (like you ship with a different carrier outside Depop), Depop will not cover you under seller protection and might even auto-cancel if no tracking is logged [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=Depop%20Shipping%20via%20USPS%20is,Easy).

- <u>Poshmark:</u> Poshmark handles shipping in a very standardized way. When an item sells on Poshmark, Poshmark emails the seller a prepaid USPS Priority Mail shipping label. Poshmark’s shipping is a flat-rate arrangement (for U.S. sales, buyers pay a flat fee - currently around $7-$8 - for up to 5 pounds, and the label is USPS Priority). As a seller, you must use the provided USPS label - you don’t choose the carrier. It’s always USPS, and specifically Priority Mail, with 1-3 day delivery. If the package is over 5 lbs or you need a different weight class, you have to upgrade the label (the buyer would have to pay extra or you cover it via a label upgrade request). Poshmark does not support other carriers or shipping outside their label system (except for the new _PoshPost Canada_ etc., but that’s region-specific). So in summary, on Poshmark the platform decides the carrier (USPS) and service (Priority Mail) for you, and you just print the label and use it.

#### Shipping Carrier

| Platform     | Who Chooses Carrier                                | Default Carrier/Label                                                                  | Seller Flexibility                                                                                    | Buyer Involvement                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **eBay**     | Seller sets shipping options when listing          | None mandated – seller can buy label via eBay (discounted USPS/UPS/FedEx) or elsewhere | Seller may change carrier if faster/appropriate, must still meet promised timeframe & upload tracking | Buyer only selects from shipping options the seller listed |
| **Depop**    | Seller chooses between Depop label or own shipping | Depop label = USPS (standard); in some regions UPS                                     | If using Depop label, carrier is fixed (USPS); if own method, seller chooses                          | Buyer pays set shipping fee, does not choose carrier       |
| **Poshmark** | Platform decides                                   | Always USPS Priority Mail (prepaid label provided)                                     | Very limited; must use provided label, can request upgrade if over 5 lbs                              | Buyer pays flat shipping fee; cannot change carrier        |

### How Quickly Must You Ship?
- <u>eBay:</u> Handling Time: On eBay, the seller specifies a handling time for each listing (e.g. 1 business day, 2 days, 3 days, etc.). This is the time you have to ship the item out, not including transit. To keep buyers happy (and potentially qualify for Top Rated Plus benefits), many sellers use 1-day handling. Whatever you set, you should ship within that window. If you don’t and the item arrives late or the buyer notices the tracking was late, it can count against your late shipment metric. There is no hard “ship by” rule beyond what you promised, but practically, if an item is not shipped within 7 days, a buyer might get concerned or eBay could allow them to cancel. eBay’s Money Back Guarantee allows buyers to open a case if the item hasn’t arrived by the latest estimated date. For new sellers, it’s wise to ship as soon as possible to avoid any issues. So, if you have a 2-day handling, try to ship in 1 day anyway. Remember, eBay measures on-time shipping either by tracking scan or buyer feedback as described earlier [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=With%20tracking%2C%20we%27ll%20count%20an,item%20as%20late%20when). In short: you decide the time, but missing it risks defects or unhappy buyers. There’s also an eBay policy: if an order hasn’t been shipped within 30 days of sale, eBay may automatically cancel it (that’s an extreme case).

- <u>Poshmark:</u> Poshmark expects sellers to ship within 7 days, and in fact after the 7th day of no shipment, the buyer has the option to cancel (and on the 10th day with no tracking, Poshmark will auto-cancel and refund the buyer) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20you%20haven%E2%80%99t%20shipped%20the,will%20receive%20a%20full%20refund). Poshmark actually encourages shipping much faster: they note most sellers ship in 1-3 days. If you ship quickly, it improves your rating and your “ship time” metric. Poshmark often sends reminders: e.g., at 3 days they might nudge you or notify the buyer the item hasn’t shipped yet. The Posh Protect policy states that if the item isn’t shipped within a certain timeframe, the order can be canceled and buyer refunded [support.poshmark.com](https://support.poshmark.com/s/topic/0TOUn0000003VthOAE/order-related?language=en_US#:~:text=Order%20Related%20,we%27ll%20refund%20you%20your%20payment). Therefore, treat 7 days as an absolute latest. In practice, for great service (and to meet the <3 day average for Ambassador), try to ship in 1-2 days.

- <u>Depop:</u> Depop’s recommended shipping time is within 3 days of the sale. Many Depop buyers expect quick shipping like other marketplaces. Depop’s policy is that if you haven’t shipped and added tracking within 10 days, the order will be automatically canceled and refunded to the buyer [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=check%20those%20before%20you%20ship). That is a hard deadline - 10 days and it auto-cancels [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20you%20haven%E2%80%99t%20shipped%20the,will%20receive%20a%20full%20refund). But waiting that long isn’t good for your reputation. Also, for Top Seller, they require 90% of orders ship within 5 days [blog.vendoo.co](https://blog.vendoo.co/make-more-sales-on-depop-and-become-a-depop-top-seller#:~:text=via%20email%29). So, ideally ship within a few days. Depop will email you a reminder to ship after a couple of days as well. In summary: Depop auto-cancels on day 10 of no shipment [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=check%20those%20before%20you%20ship), and best practice is ship in 1-3 days.

#### Shipping Time Expectations
| Platform     | Seller-Set Handling Time                  | Platform Policy / Deadline                                                              | Best Practice                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **eBay**     | Seller chooses (1–3 days common)          | Must ship within handling time promised; no hard deadline except auto-cancel at 30 days | Set 1-day handling and ship ASAP to qualify for Top Rated Plus      |
| **Poshmark** | Fixed by platform (expects within 7 days) | Buyer may cancel after 7 days, auto-cancel at 10 days if no shipment                    | Ship within 1–2 days to maintain <3 day average for Ambassador      |
| **Depop**    | Informal (expected within 3 days)         | Auto-cancel at 10 days without tracking                                                 | Ship within 1–3 days; Top Seller requires 90% shipped within 5 days |

### Notifications and Order Confirmation
- <u>eBay:</u> You (the seller) will receive an email notification from eBay saying your item sold. If you have the eBay app, you’ll get a push notification as well. The item will appear in your Seller Hub or My eBay Sold Items. eBay will show it as “Awaiting Payment” if the buyer hasn’t paid yet (for auction wins, etc.), or “Awaiting Shipment” once payment is confirmed. (With eBay’s managed payments, usually payment is automatic at purchase for Buy It Now; auctions the buyer has a few days to pay). Once it’s “Awaiting Shipment,” you should pack the item and purchase a shipping label. You can do this directly through eBay - click “Print Shipping Label” and eBay lets you buy and print a label (cost is deducted from your funds). eBay will automatically send the buyer a notification when you mark the item as shipped and upload tracking (or if you bought the label on eBay, tracking is uploaded automatically). Buyers also often get the tracking number emailed to them. Timeline: If the buyer pays immediately, you should ideally ship within your stated handling (again, eBay tracks this). There’s no additional buyer action needed unless they didn’t pay (in which case you may have to remind them or open an unpaid item case after 4 days).

- <u>Poshmark:</u> When your item sells on Poshmark, you’ll get an in-app notification and an email with the subject “Congrats! Your item sold.” Attached to that email (and downloadable in app) is the USPS shipping label for that order. You should print this label. It’s already pre-addressed to the buyer and prepaid. Package your item, put in some thank-you note if you want, and tape the label on. Then drop it off at USPS or schedule a pickup. You should mark the order as shipped in the app after you ship (Poshmark sometimes auto-detects tracking scans, but it’s good to hit “Mark as Shipped” to notify the buyer). The buyer is notified when USPS scans the package as accepted and as delivered. Poshmark will update the order status to the buyer (“Shipped” with tracking info). Timeline: Poshmark expects you to ship quickly; they send reminders if you haven’t shipped in a few days. The buyer will be waiting, as their credit card is already charged and Poshmark is holding the funds.

- <u>Depop:</u> On Depop, once an item sells, you get an app notification (and email if your settings enable). If you enabled Depop Payments (the in-app payment processor), the sale will show up under your Sold Items in the app’s Selling Hub. If you used PayPal as the payment method, you will also get a PayPal email confirming payment. Depop will provide the shipping label if you chose Depop Shipping - usually via email with a QR code and printable label, and accessible in-app [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=,if%20that%E2%80%99s%20easier%20for%20you). If you chose to ship on your own, the order details will show the buyer’s address so you can ship it. In either case, pack the item securely. If using Depop’s label, attach it and drop off at USPS (or scan the QR at the post office to print label there). If using your own shipping, buy postage (maybe via PirateShip, USPS.com, etc.) and send it. Next, important: go to the app and mark the item as shipped and enter the tracking number (if it’s not a Depop label) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20your%20shipping%20method%20is,set%20to%20%E2%80%98Other%E2%80%99) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=). Depop will then notify the buyer that the item is on its way. Depop orders remain “pending” until tracking is provided; failing to add tracking within a few days could cause buyer concern and if no tracking by day 10, cancellation occurs. After shipping, the tracking updates for the buyer through the app if you used the Depop label (or you’ve entered the number). Timeline: Aim to ship in 1-3 days for good reviews, but absolutely before 10 days as mentioned. Depop doesn’t have a manual “delivered” confirmation by the buyer like Poshmark; instead, once tracking shows delivered, Depop releases the payout 2 business days later (if using Depop Payments) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=When%20will%20I%20get%20paid%3F).

#### Notifications
| Platform     | Seller Notifications                                                                              | Buyer Notifications                                                     | Shipping Label Delivery                                                    | Timeline Notes                                                                                                  |

| **Poshmark** | In-app + email (“Congrats! Your item sold”); includes USPS label                                  | Buyer notified when order marked shipped and at each USPS scan/delivery | Label emailed and available in app; prepaid and pre-addressed              | Must ship within 7 days (auto-cancel after 10); reminders sent if not shipped quickly                           |

### Lost Packages and Insurance
- <u>eBay:</u> When you ship on eBay (especially if you buy postage through eBay), you often have an option to add insurance depending on the service. USPS Priority Mail includes $50 or $100 insurance by default; UPS and FedEx usually include $100. If a package is lost in transit (no delivery scan), the buyer can open an “Item Not Received” case. eBay will check tracking - if it never shows delivered, eBay will typically refund the buyer in full under the Money Back Guarantee [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=,Protection). As the seller, you’re generally responsible for ensuring delivery, so a lost item means you likely have to refund the buyer (eBay may do it on your behalf and deduct from your account). You can then file an insurance claim with the carrier to recoup your cost if you had insurance. If you did not insure and it’s lost, you take the loss (financially). If a package shows delivered but buyer says they didn’t get it, it’s a bit tricky: eBay usually considers a tracking status of "delivered" as proof and might deny an INR claim [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=We%20can%E2%80%99t%20guarantee%20a%20refund,steps%20to%20protect%20from%20theft) (they may encourage the buyer to check around or with neighbors [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=We%20can%E2%80%99t%20guarantee%20a%20refund,steps%20to%20protect%20from%20theft)). But sometimes buyers claim fraud (package stolen). As a seller, you might be protected if you shipped to the exact address provided and it shows delivered. eBay may cover that case via their seller protection (not guaranteed, but if your account is in good standing and you have tracking, you often won’t be out money). If an item is returned to sender (e.g., incorrect address or buyer refused), you should contact the buyer via eBay messages. You may need to correct the address and reship (after confirming with buyer and possibly charging additional postage if it was their mistake), or offer a refund minus shipping if they prefer to cancel. eBay doesn’t automatically handle RTS cases; it’s between buyer and seller to work out. No additional fees from eBay in such scenario except you might lose the original shipping cost.

- <u>Poshmark:</u> Poshmark shipments are all via USPS Priority and come with $100 of insurance by default (previously $50, now increased). If a package is lost in transit (no delivery scan after a long time), Poshmark’s Posh Protect ensures the buyer gets a refund [poshmark.com](https://poshmark.com/posh_protect?srsltid=AfmBOoqswzMc88D7o4uep67tvyu7KMu60U0T8hho4cgAlioebdS53iQU#:~:text=You%20are%20protected%20every%20time,not%20match%20the%20listing%20description). Typically, if there’s no tracking update for a certain period (around 7-10 days of inactivity beyond expected delivery), the buyer can report it and Poshmark will investigate. Poshmark may ask the seller to check with USPS or open a claim. Ultimately, if truly lost, Poshmark will refund the buyer fully [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheClosetDoor/comments/1jfzc90/lost_package_found_now_poshmark_wants_me_to_pay_up/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,used%20from%20a%20previous). What about the seller? If the item is lost by the carrier, Poshmark will not pay the seller since the transaction didn’t complete. However, since the label is insured, _the seller can file an insurance claim via USPS for the item’s value up to $100_. In practice, Poshmark might handle that claim or advise you how to do it; some sellers have reported Poshmark helps recover that money. But you won’t get your earnings unless the package is found or the claim pays out. If the item’s value was above $100, Poshmark offers the option to purchase additional insurance for high-value sales; otherwise you’re only covered to $100. If a package is marked delivered but the buyer says they didn’t receive it, Poshmark gives the buyer 3 days to report issues. If they report it not received, Poshmark will look into it (often they’ll ask the buyer to wait a bit or check locally). Because the buyer’s funds are held until they acknowledge receipt, if a package is marked delivered and the buyer doesn’t report an issue within 3 days, the funds release to you. If later they claim non-receipt, it becomes complicated - Poshmark might still reverse the transaction if there’s evidence of postal error. But generally, delivery scan = transaction complete from Poshmark’s standpoint. For _Return to Sender_ (e.g. address undeliverable), the seller should notify Poshmark support. Often, Poshmark will reach out to the buyer to confirm address. You can then re-print a new label with the corrected address. Poshmark might cancel the order if the buyer is unresponsive or address issue can’t be resolved, returning the item to you and refunding the buyer. There’s no penalty to you if it was buyer’s address error.

- <u>Depop:</u> Depop transactions are covered by Depop Protection for buyers, which states if the item doesn’t arrive or is significantly not as described, the buyer gets a full refund (if they reported within 30 days) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=,Protection). If a package is lost in the mail (tracking never shows delivered), the buyer will file a dispute via the Depop app’s Resolution Center [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=,Kingdom). Depop will check tracking; if truly lost, they refund the buyer from Depop’s side. The seller will not get paid out (and if they were already paid via PayPal, Depop/PayPal will claw the money back). If you used a Depop Shipping label, there might be some insurance (Depop’s USPS labels likely have $100 insurance like Priority, or if it was Ground Advantage, possibly $100 as well). Depop may assist the seller in claiming that, but generally they don’t automatically compensate sellers for lost items - their policy is more buyer-focused. If you shipped on your own and it got lost and you didn’t insure it, you’re out of luck for the item value. Depop encourages always using tracked shipping for this reason [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20your%20shipping%20method%20is,set%20to%20%E2%80%98Other%E2%80%99) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=If%20you%20choose%20this%20method%2C,the%20buyer%20will%20be%20refunded). If a package is returned to sender (maybe buyer’s address was wrong), you should message the buyer on Depop to confirm the address. You can then resend it (you might have to purchase a new shipping label). If the buyer doesn’t respond or wants to cancel, you can refund them and relist the item. Since Depop doesn’t have an automatic process for RTS, it relies on communication. One note: If the item was returned due to buyer address error and they still want it, you might ask them to pay the additional shipping cost (outside Depop or via a custom listing for “reship fee”) because Depop won’t provide a second label for free.

- <u>Insurance/Protection Summary:</u> eBay - optional insurance, seller often bears risk (but can mitigate via carrier claims or certain protections). Poshmark - built-in insurance up to $100, buyer always gets refund if lost, seller can claim postal insurance for reimbursement of item value. Depop - buyer protection ensures refund; seller can be left unpaid if item lost, unless covered by postal insurance (if used Depop’s label, possibly claim USPS insurance). Always pack well to avoid damage (which can also lead to claims) and consider insurance for high-value items. Keep all shipping receipts and tracking info.

### Returns and Refunds (After Delivery)
 <u>eBay:</u> 
 eBay allows sellers to set a return policy on listings. You can choose to accept returns (14-day, 30-day, or 60-day, buyer or seller paid shipping) or say “No returns.” However, even if you declare no returns, under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee, buyers can still return an item if it’s “Significantly Not As Described” (SNAD) - for example, if it arrives damaged, defective, or not as advertised. In such cases, eBay will require a return regardless of your policy. If you _do_ accept returns for buyer’s remorse (say the buyer just doesn’t want it or it didn’t fit), then the buyer can return within your stated window for any reason. eBay will generate a return shipping label (usually at buyer’s expense unless you offered free returns). The buyer ships the item back to you, you refund them, and eBay credits your final value fee back.

For SNAD cases, typically the seller provides a return label and when you get the item back, you refund in full including original shipping. If you feel the buyer is misusing the system (like lying about condition to force a return), you can appeal to eBay, but generally eBay sides with buyers in disputes. Scam prevention: The scenario the user mentioned - buyer returns a different item (like an old damaged pair of jeans instead of the ones you sent) - is unfortunately something that can happen on eBay. To protect yourself, document your items: take detailed photos, note any unique markings or serial numbers. If a buyer opens a return for a faulty item and you suspect foul play, you should respond to the return case with your evidence. eBay has a policy against buyer abuse. If you receive a return and the item is _not_ the same, you should report this to eBay immediately as “buyer sent wrong item/buyer abuse.” Take photos of what you received. In some cases, eBay may refund the buyer _and_ let you keep your funds as a one-time protection if they determine the buyer is fraudulent. There’s also a newer eBay protection where if the returned item is different or damaged beyond what the buyer claimed, you can deduct up to 50% value for the refund (called a partial refund for remorse returns) - but that doesn’t apply if the buyer claimed SNAD; it’s mostly for remorse returns where item came back used/damaged. The best prevention is to clearly describe items (so buyer can’t claim not as described), ship promptly, and keep evidence. Fortunately, such scams are a minority. Most eBay buyers are honest, but remain vigilant. Bottom line: eBay gives buyers broad return rights; as a seller you have to handle returns professionally and use eBay’s seller protections when applicable [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=What%20this%20means) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=We%20count%20a%20transaction%20defect,either%20of%20these%20things%20happen).

<u>Poshmark:</u> Poshmark’s policy is “All Sales Final” unless an item is not as described. Buyers _cannot_ return for fit, change of mind, or any other reason besides a case of misrepresentation or undisclosed damage. When a buyer receives an item, they have 3 days to inspect it and report a problem. If they do nothing, the sale is finalized and the funds are released to you. If within 3 days the buyer opens a “Case” (through the app) citing an issue, they must provide details and photos. For example, they might say “Item has a huge stain not shown in listing” and show a photo. Poshmark’s team reviews the case. If they agree the item was misrepresented, they will approve a return: the buyer will get a prepaid return label to send the item back to you, and once tracking shows it’s on its way, Poshmark refunds the buyer [support.poshmark.com](https://support.poshmark.com/s/topic/0TO1I000000kJqqWAE/faqs?language=en_US#:~:text=FAQs%20,seller%20and%20process%20your%20refund). If Poshmark finds in your favor (e.g., buyer claimed a flaw that was actually clearly described or shown, or buyer is lying), they’ll deny the return and release your funds. So, it’s important on Poshmark to describe your items accurately and include clear photos to avoid disputes. Poshmark’s system protects sellers in that frivolous returns (“I didn’t like it”) are not allowed - those will be denied as long as you sent the correct item.

If a return is approved, Poshmark holds your funds until you get the item back. Once tracking says delivered to you, Poshmark will cancel the sale. There’s no direct impact on you other than the lost sale and time - Poshmark covers the return label cost in these cases. The buyer gets their money back. If a buyer tries to scam (like swapping items), the case process usually requires them to submit photos of what they received. If they send something back to you that is wrong, you should photograph it and email Poshmark support. Poshmark tends to side with sellers if a buyer is clearly fraudulent because Poshmark can see if the return label weight differs, etc. However, such scams on Poshmark are rarer than on eBay since the window is short and Poshmark is very community-driven. One measure some Posh sellers use for high-end items is tagging them with a security tag or writing initials on an inside tag - so if a buyer removed those, it indicates tampering. Overall, Poshmark returns are relatively infrequent if you accurately describe items, and you generally won’t have to accept returns for fit issues or buyer’s remorse (just politely remind them of policy if they ask).

<u>Depop:</u> Depop’s philosophy is similar to Poshmark: all sales are final unless there’s a problem. They expect buyers to read description and ask questions before buying. There is no formal Depop “return request” system for fit or change of mind. If a buyer is unhappy but the item was as described, you (the seller) can choose to accept a return or not, it’s up to you - but through the app, there’s no mechanism to process it. Many Depop sellers say “no returns” in their profiles. However, if the item is significantly not as described or damaged, the buyer can open a PayPal dispute or Depop Payments dispute. Depop’s Buyer Protection (if they used the Depop “Buy” button) will require them to report within 30 days if something is wrong [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=,Protection). Depop will usually instruct the buyer to return the item to you to get a refund, similar to eBay. As a seller, if you agree the item had an issue, you can refund the buyer through the app or PayPal and possibly have them ship it back. If the buyer goes through Depop’s official channel and Depop rules against you, they will force a refund and likely require the buyer to send the item back.
    
    To avoid scams (like the jeans swap scenario) on Depop: since many payments go through PayPal, remember PayPal’s Seller Protection. If you shipped to the confirmed address and have proof of what you sent, you might dispute a false “SNAD” claim. PayPal sometimes asks the buyer to return the item first. If they return a wrong item, you can appeal to PayPal with evidence. Depop’s own system (for Depop Payments) presumably works similarly - they’d want the item returned to you. If you receive a box of rocks instead of the shoes you sold, immediately report to Depop support. Again, document your items and interactions. Fortunately, Depop’s demographic and culture (more informal, social media-like) doesn’t foster as many return scams, but it can happen. When in doubt, communicate. Sometimes a buyer might ask nicely for a return due to fit - in those cases, you _can_ choose to do it (you’d have them ship it back and then refund via PayPal or ask Depop to cancel transaction). But you’re not obligated by Depop policy to do returns for that reason.

Preventing Return Fraud: For all platforms, a few general tips to prevent the scenario of receiving a different item back:
- Take pictures of your item, including any serial numbers or unique identifiers, before shipping. For clothing, some sellers subtly mark an inside seam or tag.
- For high-value items, record the packing process or use tamper-proof tags (special tags that must be intact for a return).
- Save your correspondence with buyers (on-platform messaging) in case they admit something or give inconsistent info.
- If a buyer has very low ratings or seems suspicious, be extra cautious; you might even choose to cancel a sale if it seems very fishy (though that can affect metrics - use sparingly).
- Use signature confirmation for very expensive items (eBay allows adding that service, and Poshmark automatically requires signature over $400).

If despite precautions a buyer attempts a scam, leverage the platform’s support with your evidence. eBay has seller protection policies that can shield you from abusive buyers (e.g., not count a defect, or in rare cases allow you to keep funds) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=When%20a%20buyer%20reports%20that,responsible%20for%20providing%20a%20resolution) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=We%20count%20a%20transaction%20defect,either%20of%20these%20things%20happen). Poshmark’s small community vibe means blatant scammers often get booted. Depop, being smaller, might personally handle such incidents if reported.

## Penalties for Not Meeting Requirements
---
### eBay Penalties: 
If you do not meet minimum performance (i.e. become Below Standard), eBay will impose restrictions. These include:
- Higher Fees: an additional 5% final value fee surcharge on sales while you are below standard [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,fees%2C%20until%20your%20performance%20improves). This directly hits your profits.
- Selling Limits: eBay may lower your selling limits or freeze increases. They might block you from listing certain categories or reduce your monthly allowable listings until you improve [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=If%20your%20current%20or%20projected,For%20more%20help%2C%20read%20our).
- Lowered Search Visibility: Though not always explicitly stated, being Below Standard can hurt your placement in eBay search results (your listings may appear lower, reducing sales).
- Account Holds: In severe cases, eBay can temporarily restrict your ability to list or even suspend the account if performance is awful or if you have a serious policy violation. For example, a string of counterfeit item complaints can lead to an account ban.
- Funds Holds: For new sellers or those with issues, eBay may put a hold on your payouts (they can hold funds up to 21 days in some cases) until they see successful deliveries.

There aren’t monetary fines beyond the fee increase, but those can be significant (5% of all sales adds up). So it’s crucial to get back to Above Standard. eBay provides guidance and sometimes a grace period to improve if you slip.

### Poshmark Penalties: 
Poshmark doesn’t have explicit monetary penalties or a tier like “Below Standard”. However, there are some things to avoid:
- Too Many Cancellations: If you as a seller cancel orders frequently (especially after making a buyer wait), Poshmark could issue a warning or mute your account temporarily. I’ve seen instances where Poshmark sends a note about “frequent cancellations negatively impact the community.”
- Inactivity: Not shipping items or not responding to buyers can lead to poor ratings and potentially the loss of Posh Ambassador status if your stats drop (though PA status isn’t removed for inactivity unless you drop below requirements drastically).
- Guideline Violations: If you break rules (e.g., sell prohibited items, conduct off-platform transactions which is against terms, or harass users), Poshmark can restrict or ban you. A typical penalty is a temporary share jail or restrict - e.g., if you use a bot to self-share and Poshmark detects it, they might disable sharing for your account for a time.
- Posh Ambassador Demotion: For PA II, if you fail the quarterly maintenance requirements, you likely lose the PA II benefits/badge until you re-qualify. PA I, as mentioned, once earned generally stays, but presumably if someone severely violates rules Poshmark could strip it (that would coincide with account issues anyway).
- No direct fees or fines for performance issues on Poshmark - just loss of perks or account standing.

### Depop Penalties: 
Depop is known to be strict with policy enforcement:

- Account Suspension: Depop can and will suspend accounts for violations or poor behavior. Common reasons: selling fakes, repeatedly not shipping items (taking money and not sending), or a pattern of bad buyer reviews. Suspensions can be permanent bans. In some cases Depop might suspend first and ask questions later (you then have to appeal).
- Loss of Top Seller: If you’re a Top Seller and you stop meeting criteria (e.g., your rating falls or you dip below $1000 sales or you commit an infringement), Depop will remove you from the Top Seller program [blog-staging.depop.com](https://blog-staging.depop.com/articles/how-to-become-a-top-seller#:~:text=For%20four%20consecutive%20months%2C%20you%27ll,and%20ship%20your%20items). You’d lose the benefits until you can earn it back.
- Search Demotion: While not officially stated, Depop’s algorithm could favor sellers who ship fast and have good ratings. If you consistently ship late or get bad reviews, your items might not show up as prominently. There’s anecdotal evidence that Depop’s “Explore” and search is curated to highlight good sellers.
- No fee penalties: Depop doesn’t charge extra fees for underperformance (they either allow you to sell or they don’t). But if you incur chargebacks (say you had a bunch of PayPal chargebacks), that can lead to issues or even owing money if Depop had to cover refunds.

| **Depop**    | None direct                                       | Strict enforcement; accounts suspended for fakes, non-shipping, bad behavior                    | Anecdotally, poor performance lowers placement in search/explore       | Loss of Top Seller status if criteria unmet                | Chargebacks/PayPal disputes can lead to further issues              |

> [!info]
>Monetary penalties are mainly an eBay thing (extra fees). Poshmark and Depop penalties are more about losing status or account privileges. No platform charges a seller a straight “fine” for not meeting metrics (they instead limit your ability to sell, which indirectly costs you potential revenue).

## Payment Flow and Getting Paid
---
### eBay:
eBay now uses Managed Payments (no more direct PayPal to the seller; eBay acts as the intermediary). When a buyer purchases your item, they pay eBay (via credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc. - multiple methods). eBay then initiates a payout to your linked bank account, typically within 2 business days of payment confirmation [ebay.ca](https://www.ebay.ca/help/selling/getting-paid/getting-paid-items-sold-?id=4814#:~:text=Getting%20paid%20for%20items%20you%27ve,payouts%20are%20scheduled%20weekly%2C). You can set your payout schedule to daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly [ebay.ca](https://www.ebay.ca/sellercentre/payments-and-fees/payments-and-earnings#:~:text=Payments%20and%20earnings%20,daily%2C%20weekly%2C%20biweekly%2C%20or%20monthly). Most sellers choose daily payouts, which means eBay will send any cleared funds to your bank every day (usually the day after payment, with a 1-2 day processing). For example, if your item sold and the buyer paid on Monday, by Wednesday eBay would initiate the deposit to your bank (which might show up by Thursday or Friday depending on your bank). If you prefer weekly, eBay will accumulate your sales and send them as a lump sum once a week (often on Tuesday) [cedcommerce.com](https://cedcommerce.com/blog/ebay-managed-payments/?srsltid=AfmBOoolVCmXZFtZlRjUlTyG2egmiC2uz28uoX05PPYdEzMCbijyua_Z#:~:text=What%20is%20eBay%20Managed%20Payments%3F,Additionally%2C).

For new sellers, eBay may hold funds a bit longer - often until tracking shows the item delivered or 7 days after tracking shows shipped, or max 21 days if no confirmation. This is a temporary measure for newbie accounts (to ensure no immediate fraud). After you build some history, funds will flow on the regular schedule without holds (unless an issue arises like a chargeback).

Fees are deducted before payout: eBay will subtract their final value fee and any other fees from the buyer’s payment, then the rest is your net that gets deposited. So you won’t get paid by the buyer directly; it’s routed through eBay. If a buyer doesn’t pay (which can happen in auctions or best offers they accepted), eBay doesn’t send a payout obviously. You’d have to cancel the order for non-payment in that case (and you get a fee credit, etc.). But for immediate payments, you can consider the money essentially in eBay’s pipeline to you.

### Poshmark:
When a buyer purchases on Poshmark, they pay Poshmark (via credit card or PayPal). Poshmark then holds that payment in escrow until the transaction is complete. The funds show up in your Poshmark account as pending (not spendable yet). Once the USPS tracking shows the package delivered, the buyer has 3 days to inspect the item. If after 3 days the buyer does nothing (or if they manually accept the order on arrival), Poshmark releases the payment to you. This goes into your Poshmark account balance (not directly to your bank). You will get a notification “You’ve been paid!” and your balance will show the amount of earnings. You must then withdraw the funds from Poshmark to your bank (or you can use the balance to purchase on Poshmark if you want).

Withdrawals can be done anytime: you can request a direct deposit to your bank (which takes 1-3 business days typically to show up in your account) or you can request a paper check (if over $10, Poshmark will mail you a check, taking a couple weeks). Most go with direct deposit for speed. There’s no set schedule - you trigger it when you want. Many sellers accumulate some balance and withdraw in batches. There are no additional fees for withdrawing.

If something goes wrong (buyer opens a case), those funds remain on hold until resolved. If refunded, they never hit your balance; if you win the case, then they release as normal.

### Depop:
Depop has two payment routes. Historically, Depop used PayPal integration, and now they also have Depop Payments (Stripe) for cards/Apple Pay.

- If the buyer pays via PayPal on Depop, the money goes directly into your PayPal account immediately at time of purchase. (Minus the Depop fee which Depop later charges/invoices you for). In this scenario, it’s almost as if you did a normal PayPal transaction; however, to be covered, the transaction must be tagged as a Depop sale in PayPal (which it is if they clicked Buy on Depop). You might see the funds as pending in PayPal if you’re a new PayPal seller (PayPal sometimes holds funds for new accounts until tracking shows delivered, similar to eBay’s old process). But generally, PayPal gets you the money quickly, and you can use or withdraw from PayPal to your bank as you wish. Depop will still take their 10% fee by billing your card on file or deducting from your Depop balance.

- If the buyer pays via Depop Payments (credit/debit card, Apple/Google Pay, Klarna), the money first goes to Depop/Stripe. The sale amount (minus fees) is added to your Depop Balance. It will be marked as “pending” until you ship and the item is delivered. According to Depop, they will send your payout 2 business days after tracking shows delivered, or 10 business days after the sale if no delivery scan (i.e., perhaps the buyer didn’t tap delivered but time passed) - whichever comes first [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=When%20will%20I%20get%20paid%3F). This protects buyers somewhat like Poshmark does, but with a defined max timeline of 10 business days (~2 weeks). Once Depop releases the payout, it goes to your bank account on file, not to a Depop wallet you manually withdraw from (Depop attempts to be automatic). Depop says payouts can take up to 5 days to appear in your bank after they send it [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=You%E2%80%99ll%20be%20paid%20after%20your,sale%20%E2%80%94%20whichever%20comes%20first) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=sale%20%E2%80%94%20whichever%20comes%20first). In practice, many Depop sellers see the money in their bank a few days after the item is delivered. If an item is delivered quickly, you might see payout within a week of sale. If tracking doesn’t update (lost item), Depop will not pay you; they’d refund the buyer instead via the claim process.

Depop is working on giving all users the ability to manually withdraw or use balance like a wallet [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=Earnings%20from%20your%20sales%20are,to%20your%20connected%20bank%20account), but currently it’s largely automatic to bank. Ensure you set up your bank details in the app so you don’t miss payouts. If a buyer opens a dispute before payout, Depop will hold the funds until resolved.

> [!info]
> - <u>eBay</u> - essentially daily or as set, once payment clears (no waiting for buyer satisfaction, except new seller hold scenario). 
> - <u>Poshmark</u> - on buyer acceptance or 3 days after delivery, then you withdraw (so could be around a week from sale to your bank if you withdraw immediately and your bank processes fast). 
> - <u>Depop</u> - about 2 days after delivery to initiate payout, funds to bank in a couple more days; roughly, a bit faster than Poshmark in releasing but slower than eBay because of the delivery confirmation requirement.

## Fees on Each Platform
---
### eBay:
- Insertion Fee (Listing Fee): You get a certain number of free listings per month (typically 250 free per month for a non-store casual seller on eBay US). If you exceed those or list in categories not covered by free allotment, you pay a fee for listing an item (often $0.35 per listing for most categories). Many clothing sellers won’t hit 250 in a month starting out, so likely you won’t pay insertion fees initially [export.ebay.com](https://export.ebay.com/en/first-steps/rules-and-restrictions-in-selling/selling-limits/#:~:text=You%20might%20also%20be%20interested,in). If you open an eBay Store, you pay a subscription but get more free listings and lower fees.

- Final Value Fee (Commission): When your item sells, eBay charges a percentage of the total amount paid by the buyer (item price + shipping). For most categories (including clothing), this fee is around 13.25% for non-store sellers as of 2025, and slightly lower (often ~12-12.5%) for store subscribers. There is also a $0.30 fixed transaction fee per order (similar to PayPal’s old 30¢ fee) [autods.com](https://www.autods.com/blog/suppliers-marketplaces/top-rated-seller-on-ebay/#:~:text=How%20To%20Become%20A%20Top,us%20reduce%20overall%20selling%20costs). So if you sell a shirt for $20 with free shipping, you might pay roughly $2.65 to eBay (13.25% of $20) plus $0.30, totaling about $2.95 in fees. If you were Top Rated Plus on that sale, you could get a 10% discount on the variable portion [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=eBay%20Top%20Rated%20Plus%20requirements,and%20benefits) [ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,High%20in%20your%20service%20metrics).

- Promoted Listings (optional): If you choose to promote your listing (e.g., have it show up as a sponsored item in search), you set an extra percentage you’re willing to pay. That fee only is charged if the item sells via a click on the ad. This is optional, but many sellers use it to boost visibility.

- Store Subscription Fees (optional): If you run an eBay Store, you pay a monthly fee (ranging from about $5 for Starter to $60 for Premium, and higher for Anchor, etc.) [export.ebay.com](https://export.ebay.com/en/first-steps/rules-and-restrictions-in-selling/selling-limits/#:~:text=You%20might%20also%20be%20interested,in) [export.ebay.com](https://export.ebay.com/en/first-steps/rules-and-restrictions-in-selling/selling-limits/#:~:text=Zero%20insertion%20fee%20listings%20eBay,subscriptions%20and%20fees%20Multiple%20accounts). These give you more free listings and perks. As a beginner, you likely don’t need a store until you have consistent volume.

- Payment Processing: eBay’s final value fee now _includes_ payment processing. There’s no separate PayPal fee because eBay handles it. So the percentage they take covers everything except perhaps sales tax (which the buyer pays and eBay remits; you don’t pay fee on sales tax in most cases).

- Penalty Fees: If you’re Below Standard, remember the +5% surcharge on final value fees[ebay.com](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#:~:text=,fees%2C%20until%20your%20performance%20improves). Also, if you have very high dispute rates in certain categories, eBay might add 4% in those categories (this is an “additional fee” for sellers with lots of “item not as described” returns in specific categories - hopefully not applicable to you if you’re careful).

    _Example:_ Sell a jacket for $50 + $10 shipping charged to buyer = $60 total. Final value fee at 13.25% = $7.95, + $0.30 = $8.25 fee. If you have a store Basic, that might drop to say 12%, so $7.20 + $0.30 = $7.50. If Top Rated Plus, 10% off that $7.20 = $6.48 + $0.30 = ~$6.78. You see how status can save money in eBay’s model. Insertion fee would be $0 if within free allotment.

### Poshmark:
- Flat 20% commission on the final sale price for sales of $15 or more [amzscout.net](https://amzscout.net/blog/what-to-sell-on-poshmark/#:~:text=What%20Can%20You%20Sell%20on,Damaged%20or%20Unsafe%20Items%3A). For sales under $15, they instead take a flat $2.95 fee. So, if you sell something for $10, you keep $7.05; if you sell for $15, 20% of $15 is $3, so you’d actually net $12 (which is slightly more favorable than the flat fee would have been). At $20, 20% is $4, net $16, etc.

- There are no listing fees, no payment processing fees, no fees for withdrawing your money. The buyer typically pays for shipping separately, so you’re not losing fee on shipping (the price you set is what the fee is based on). If you offer a shipping discount to the buyer (a feature on Poshmark for making offers), you as the seller cover that discount - effectively it reduces your earnings. But Poshmark’s 20% is only on the item price.

- No additional hidden fees. That 20% covers the credit card processing, the platform, everything. It is a bit steep compared to eBay for high-price items, but there’s no hassle of multiple fee types.

    Poshmark doesn’t penalize with higher fees for performance issues - everyone has the same rate (unless some special promotion or reduced fee event which is rare). So planning your pricing means usually marking up a bit to account for that 20%. Many Posh sellers use the rule of thumb: list at a price that gives you wiggle room for offers and still leaves profit after 20%.

### Depop: 
- Standard fee is 10% of the sale price. This is taken from the transaction automatically. If the buyer paid via PayPal, Depop will charge the 10% to your card on file or deduct from any Depop Balance you have (sometimes it batches charges periodically). If the buyer paid via Depop Payments, Depop just deducts their 10% before giving you the payout [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360038461713-Depop-Protection-for-buyers#:~:text=Your%20full%20purchase%20price%20,you%20qualify%20for%20Depop%20Protection). In addition, if using Depop Payments (Stripe), there is a payment processing fee, which as of recent rates is about 3.3% + $0.45 for US transactions (this covers credit card fees). PayPal payments have PayPal’s fee which is roughly 3% + $0.30, but if buyer paid through Depop’s checkout, I believe PayPal may give a slightly different rate under their Micropayments, etc. But safe to assume ~3% + fixed fee. So effectively:

- Depop total fees ≈ 13% + $0.30-$0.45, similar to eBay’s range. Depop often quotes it as “10% Depop fee + PayPal/Processing fee”. For example, an item sells for $40. Depop fee $4.00, Stripe fee maybe $1.32 + $0.45 = $1.77, total ~$5.77 in fees, net to you about $34.23.

- No listing fees on Depop. Just the commission when it sells.

- If you refund a transaction, Depop will typically refund the fees as well (or not charge the fee).

- Depop doesn’t have any monthly store cost either. It’s pay-as-you-sell.

    Keep in mind, if you use PayPal outside of Depop (some sellers do off-app deals to avoid fees - not recommended as it voids Depop protection), you’d only have PayPal’s fee. But doing so risks getting you banned if Depop finds out, plus you lose the Depop search boost of sales through the app.

> [!info]
> Poshmark’s fee is highest at 20% but very straightforward (and covers a lot like free credit card processing, label, etc.), eBay’s effective fee ~12-15% varies by category and seller status (plus potential $0.30 order fee and possibly insertion fees for high volume), Depop around 13% with processing. When pricing items for cross-listing, remember these differences. For example, many sellers list a bit higher on Poshmark to account for the higher fee, whereas on eBay/Depop you might price slightly lower. But market demand also dictates price, so it’s a balance.

## Order Lifecycle Overview
---
### eBay Order LifeCycle:
1. Item Listed on eBay.
2. Buyer Purchases (either via Buy It Now or winning an auction). They commit to buy and send payment to eBay.
3. Notification: You get email/app notification of the sale. In eBay Seller Hub, it shows “Awaiting Shipment”. Buyer’s shipping address is visible in the order details.
4. Shipping Label: You (seller) either purchase a label on eBay or use a third-party. You print and package the item.
5. Ship Item: Drop off with carrier. Mark as shipped on eBay (if you bought label on eBay this may auto-mark shipped and provide tracking). Tracking number is provided to buyer automatically if label bought on eBay or manually if not.
6. Handling Time: You ship ideally within your stated handling time. Buyer gets an email that item is shipped with tracking info.
7. In Transit: Buyer can monitor tracking. You should too, to ensure it’s delivered properly.
8. Delivery: The item is delivered. eBay may send delivery confirmation email to buyer. Transaction considered complete from shipment perspective.
9. Buyer Feedback: Buyer has an option to leave feedback (positive, neutral, negative) for you, and possibly a star rating in detailed seller ratings (shipping time, item as described, etc.). This isn’t required but many buyers do leave feedback.
10. Return Window: If you offered returns, the buyer could initiate within your timeframe. If not, buyer could still raise an issue if something’s wrong. If 30 days pass with no issues, you’re mostly in the clear (eBay’s Money Back Guarantee is typically 30 days from delivery for claims).
11. Payout: Meanwhile, eBay releases your funds as per the managed payments schedule. Often, you might see the payout initiated a day or two after buyer pays (which could be even before delivery if you’re an established seller). For new sellers, it might only release after confirmation of delivery. The payout goes to your bank (taking 1-3 days to actually deposit).
12. Complete: You got paid, buyer is happy (hopefully), maybe feedback exchanged. Done.

### Poshmark Order Lifecycle:
1. Item Listed in your Poshmark closet.
2. Buyer Purchases by clicking Buy or making an Offer that you accept. Their payment is collected by Poshmark at checkout.
3. Notification: You get an app notification and email “Congrats, item sold!” with the shipping label.
4. Ship Item: You pack the item, print the prepaid USPS Priority label, attach it. You drop it at USPS or schedule pickup. In the app, you tap “Mark as Shipped” (optional, but good practice).
5. Transit: USPS ships the item. Tracking is automatically linked to the order. Both you and the buyer can see updates. Poshmark emails both parties when item is out for delivery and delivered (often).
6. Delivery: USPS marks delivered. Now the buyer’s 3-day inspection clock starts. Buyer is prompted to “Accept” the order in the app and rate you.
7. Rating: Buyer can leave a 5-star rating with optional comment (Love Note) or if less than 5 stars it remains private (you see the star count but no comment). If no issues, many buyers just let the 3 days pass without doing anything.
8. Funds Release: Either immediately upon buyer hitting “Accept” or automatically 72 hours after delivery (if buyer does nothing), Poshmark releases the payment to you. Your Poshmark Balance is updated.
9. Withdraw: You initiate a withdrawal to your bank (ACH transfer). This takes a couple of days to show in your bank account.
10. If Problem: If buyer opens a case within 3 days, the funds stay on hold. You’ll be notified and get to respond in the case comments. Poshmark will moderate. If return approved, buyer sends item back and then your funds are cancelled. If denied, funds release as normal.
11. Complete: Transaction done. You got paid (minus Posh fees) and hopefully got a nice Love Note or at least 5-star rating.

### Depop Order Lifecycle:
1. Item Listed on Depop (with your chosen shipping method set and payment method active).
2. Buyer Purchases via the Depop app’s buy button. Payment is processed (via Depop Payments or PayPal).
3. Notification: You get an app notification of sale. If Depop Payments, the sale is in your Depop Selling Hub; if PayPal, you also get a PayPal email/payment.
4. Shipping: If you selected Depop Shipping, Depop sends you the label (email with QR code/label, also in app). If “Ship on your own”, you got the address from the order details. You pack the item.
5. Ship Item: If Depop label, print it or use QR code at USPS to print, then drop off. If your own, buy postage, put the label on, drop off. In the app, add tracking number and mark as shipped (Depop label might auto-add tracking; still ensure it’s marked shipped) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=This%20means%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20currently,and%20pay%20for%20shipping%20yourself) [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/16523051318033-How-to-ship-US#:~:text=).
6. Transit: Item is in transit. Depop shows the tracking status in the order details for both parties if provided.
7. Delivery: Once delivered, Depop (for Depop Payments sales) will schedule your payout to initiate 2 business days after delivery [depophelp.zendesk.com](https://depophelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9057092334865-How-do-I-get-paid-US#:~:text=When%20will%20I%20get%20paid%3F). If the sale was via PayPal, the money might have already been in your PayPal (though PayPal might hold it until delivered if you’re new).
8. Buyer Feedback: Buyers can leave a public star rating/review on Depop. You can also rate the buyer. These reviews show on profiles.
9. Issue Window: Buyer has up to 30 days to raise an issue via Depop/PayPal. Usually, if they haven’t reported anything in a week or so after delivery, you’re probably fine. Depop doesn’t have an “auto accept” like Posh because funds aren’t held as long (except they do hold for up to 10 business days regardless).
10. Payout: Depop sends the payout to your bank (if Depop Payments) or the PayPal payment is now yours to withdraw. Depop payments arriving in your bank might take a couple more days after initiation.
11. Complete: Done. If buyer is happy, you likely see a 5-star review. If not, they’d contact you or open dispute fairly soon.

> [!warning]
> If a Depop buyer chooses to message you and pay outside the app (e.g., via Venmo or something), that lifecycle would not involve Depop at all - but _don’t do this_, as it violates terms and you lose protection.

## Cross-Listing and Inventory Management Tools
---

### List Perfectly:
[List Perfectly](https://listperfectly.com/) is essentially a browser extension that allows you to create a listing once and then copy it to multiple marketplaces including eBay, Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Etsy, etc. You can also import existing listings from one platform and then post them to others. _How it works:_ You store your listing data in List Perfectly’s catalog or start from one platform’s listing, then click buttons to open new listing drafts on other platforms with the photos and details pre-filled. It’s not fully automatic (it opens the site’s listing page with fields filled, but you often have to verify and submit each one). List Perfectly supports about 11 marketplaces. 

- _Pricing:_ List Perfectly has tiered plans (around $29 to $69 per month) depending on features like bulk cross-posting and image management. There’s no per-listing fee, just the flat monthly.
- _Inventory Management:_ List Perfectly offers an inventory dashboard where you can see your listings and where they’re posted, but it does not automatically delist items when they sell. You have to manually mark as sold and then have it remove from other platforms. It provides templates and a centralized catalog, but think of it primarily as a listing copier tool.
- _Pros:_ Supports many platforms, very reliable in copying data, has some bulk tools (higher plans allow bulk crossposting multiple listings in one go).
- _Cons:_ The interface is a bit utilitarian. No mobile app (it’s desktop-oriented). No direct analytics or accounting features beyond just tracking listings. You must still manually manage inventory sold status (although LP might allow you to note an item as sold).
- _Accounting:_ List Perfectly itself doesn’t compute profits or track expenses; it’s more for listing management.

### Vendo:
 [Vendoo](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Crosslist%20to%2010%2B%20marketplaces%20with,just%20a%20few%20clicks) is another popular tool with a more modern interface and a web platform + mobile app. It also lets you cross-post listings to about 10 marketplaces (eBay, Posh, Depop, Mercari, Etsy, Grailed, etc.) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Crosslist%20to%2010%2B%20marketplaces%20with,just%20a%20few%20clicks) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Image). With Vendoo, you can create or import listings into Vendoo’s inventory system, and then push them out to platforms. Vendoo integrates via API or direct, making the process smoother and largely done within one dashboard (less opening many tabs compared to List Perfectly) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Manage%20Everything%20From%20One%20Clean,%E2%80%94%20Not%20On%20Multiple%20Tabs) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=A%20simple%20and%20intuitive%20user,that%20slow%20down%20your%20computer).

- _Pricing:_ Vendoo’s pricing is tiered by how many new listings you publish through it per month. For example, a plan might allow 125 items for ~$19/month, 250 items for $29, etc. You can also pay for add-ons like importing existing listings from all marketplaces or the _Delist/relist_ add-on.
- _Inventory Management:_ Vendoo shines here - it has an inventory page where each item shows which marketplaces it’s listed on. If it sells on one platform, you can click “mark as sold” and Vendoo can prompt you to delist from others. They even introduced an auto-delist feature: Vendoo can detect when you get a sale (on eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop) and then automatically remove the listing from the other platforms to prevent double-selling [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Image%3A%20Sale%20Detection%20and%20Automatic,Delist) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Auto,Sells). This is huge for inventory management - it saves time and prevents mistakes. (List Perfectly currently requires manual delisting).
- _Mobile App:_ Vendoo has a mobile app that lets you create and cross-list items on the go [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Resell%20On,App) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Vendoo%20is%20the%20only%20reselling,business%20on%20the%20go%20easy). This is unique as many cross-list tools are desktop-only. So you could snap pictures on your phone and list across platforms without needing to transfer to a PC.
- _Analytics & Accounting:_ Vendoo has a Sales Analytics page - if you input your Cost of Goods for each item and mark items as sold with sale price, it will show profit, revenue, fees per marketplace, etc. It’s basic accounting but helpful to see a dashboard of your total sales per platform and net earnings. It’s not a full accounting software, but it tracks those key numbers if you maintain your data there. Vendoo also can track your inventory age, etc.
- Vendoo’s new features include sharing tools (they can auto-share your Poshmark closet and even refresh Depop listings) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=The%20most%20sophisticated%20software%20for,Inventory%20Management) [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Marketplace%20sharing) - something List Perfectly doesn’t do. Vendoo has become more all-in-one: cross-listing, inventory sync, basic posh sharing and relisting tools.
- _Pros:_ User-friendly interface, great inventory tracking, auto delist, mobile app, supports many platforms, and they are eBay-certified [vendoo.co](https://www.vendoo.co/vendoo-vs-listperfectly#:~:text=Certified%20eBay%20Solutions%20Provide) (which is a trust indicator).
- _Cons:_ The pricing by number of listings per month means if you have a lot of inventory, it could be pricier than List Perfectly’s flat plan. For example, listing 300 new items in a month might push you into a higher plan or require add-on purchase for extra listings. Also, importing existing listings from all platforms may cost extra.

### Crosslist:
[Crosslist](https://crosslist.com/) is a newer competitor that emphasizes speed and automation. It works similarly: you can import or create listings and crosspost to multiple sites. Crosslist markets an “autoposting” feature that can list in the background without you opening each tab [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=Crosslist%20highlights%20its%20autoposting%20capabilities%2C,which%20could%20risk%20rate%20limits) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=According%20to%20Crosslist%27s%20comparison%20page%2C,as%20advantages%20over%20List%20Perfectly). It also supports a bunch of marketplaces (including some international) and claims to transfer all listing fields including category on all plans (some others might require higher plan for category mapping). Crosslist also offers automatic delisting when items sell [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=A%20significant%20operational%20difference%20highlighted,feature%20when%20an%20item%20sells) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=process%20compared%20to%20List%20Perfectly%27s,feature%20when%20an%20item%20sells).

- _Pricing:_ Crosslist has plans based on number of listings as well. They advertise as cheaper than List Perfectly - e.g., $29.99 for 200 listings/month, up to $44.99 for unlimited [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=follows%3A). All features included at any plan. So cost-wise it can be competitive.
- _Features:_ Similar crossposting functions, background listing to avoid API rate limits (they space out the uploads so it doesn’t trigger captchas). They don’t yet have a mobile app to my knowledge. They currently might not have Poshmark sharing tools like Vendoo does.
- Crosslist’s interface is clean and they focus on efficiency. They also support bulk editing and delisting.
- _Inventory management:_ It tracks where listings are posted and, like Vendoo, if a sale happens it can auto-remove others (per their claims) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/top-alternatives-to-list-perfectly-in-2025/#:~:text=Perfectly).
- _Strengths:_ More affordable for many, good automation, supports some platforms not on others (like some int’l markets).
- _Weaknesses:_ Slightly fewer total platforms than LP (but covers the main ones). It might not handle some marketplace quirks like auction listings on eBay (some cross-listers only do fixed price easily). It also doesn’t manage messages or other aspects.

### Other Tools:
- PrimeLister: Another cross-posting tool similar to LP and Vendoo. It also offers Poshmark automation (sharing, etc.). Pricing is comparable, with separate plans for crosslisting and Poshmark bot features.

- OneShop: A newer app that focuses on automating social tasks (sharing, following, offers) and also has cross-listing capability to multiple platforms. It markets itself as an AI assistant for reselling. It has a monthly fee and tries to streamline everything including delisting sold items, sending offers to likers, relisting stale items, etc. It’s relatively new and mobile-focused.

- Reeva: The company behind some of the blog sources, Reeva is a platform that appears to integrate listing across channels and also emphasize AI (like AI-generated descriptions) and analytics. They even mention a “full accounting service for resale businesses” [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Bulk%20products%20management%20Bulk%20list%2C,access%20Manage%20on%20desktop%2C%20mobile), meaning they might help track all transactions and provide reports for taxes, etc. Reeva is likely a more premium solution aimed at power sellers (they mention things like multi-user access, which is useful if you have employees) [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=). This could be beyond the scope for someone just starting, but it’s worth noting such a service exists if you scale up.

- OneShop: claims to auto-delist and track performance; it likely has analytics like “you sold X this week”.

- Reeva: per their site, has business analytics and can track sales/profits across channels [blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=)[blog.reeva.ai](https://blog.reeva.ai/resources/poshmark-ambassadors-how-to-become-one-and-its-benefits/#:~:text=Bulk%20products%20management%20Bulk%20list%2C,access%20Manage%20on%20desktop%2C%20mobile). Possibly they aggregate your marketplace transactions for accounting (maybe even integrate with QuickBooks or so).

Vendoo tends to be praised for ease of use and auto-delist, especially by multi-platform sellers who sell a high volume [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheClosetDoor/comments/1b58dlb/which_cross_listing_app_do_you_use/#:~:text=Which%20Cross%20Listing%20App%20Do,you%20are%20growing%20your) [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheClosetDoor/comments/1b58dlb/which_cross_listing_app_do_you_use/#:~:text=Vendoo%27s%20mobile%20app%20is%20much,you%20are%20growing%20your). List Perfectly is liked for its stability and unlimited listing plans (good if you list a ton each month and don’t want per-item costs). Crosslist is touted for being budget-friendly and efficient (the background posting appeals to some). If you also want to automate social tasks on Poshmark or Depop (sharing, refreshing), some tools incorporate that (Vendoo does for Poshmark and has a form of Depop relist; PrimeLister and OneShop also do those).

In terms of accounting: None of these fully replace an accounting system, but they definitely help track your inventory status (listed/sold) and calculate basic profits. For true accounting (including expenses beyond COGS, taxes, etc.), you might still maintain a spreadsheet or use a dedicated accounting app (some use QuickBooks Self-Employed, or reseller-specific ones like MyResellerGenie or EZ Inventory). However, the data these cross-listing tools provide (sales totals, fees, profits) can be exported and given to your accountant or used for tax filing prep.
