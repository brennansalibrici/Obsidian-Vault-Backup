### Selling Limits
---
#### Listing Limits
- Limits are automatically reviewed and adjusted every month by eBay based on your recent sales volume and customer feedback. 
- Both *Active* and *Sold* listings count toward your monthly limit. 
- eBay will automatically pull listings you post that are beyond your monthly limit. 
- 'Good til Canceled' listing do not automatically renew if you've reached your monthly limit
- eBay will send you a message when you're approaching your limit. You can request an increase from a link in that message or from [here](https://www.ebay.com/help/action?topicId=4107&af=2)
- If you're using multiple selling accounts, you can link those accounts and request an increase form the larger more established account. 

#### Category Limits
- When you're new to a particular category, eBay limits how much you can sell. This is to show you can:
	- Manage the inventory in that new category and are capable of satisfying customer demand
	- Become familiar with and prove you understand that particular categories rules 
- ALWAYS list items in their proper category. If you've reached your monthly selling limit for a certain category, don't list items in the wrong one [Manipulation Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-policies/search-browse-manipulation-policy?id=4243)[^1]

## Seller Performance 
---
- Metrics and requirements are designed promote buyer confidence on the eBay platform. Performance is evaluated <u>monthly</u> based on recent sales/activity
- 2 types of evaluation. 
	- ### Seller Standards[^2]
	
		#### All possible ratings 
		<u>Top Rated</u> - exceeding eBay's performance standards, established sales history and history of compliance with eBay's rules
		<u>Above Standard</u> - meeting eBay's expectations
		<u>Below Standard</u> - performance has fallen below eBay's expectations and limits may be placed on selling and higher final value charges

		#### Metric Calculation:
		##### LOOK-BACK PERIOD:
		- transactions > 400 in last 3 months, LOOK-BACK PERIOD = 3 months
		- transactions < 400 in last 3 months LOOK-BACK PERIOD = 12 months

		- ##### Cases Closed without seller resolution  ^df1f50
			- ###### meaning - seller is responsible to provide a resolution if:
				- Buyer reports the package hasn't arrived
				- Buyer wants a return
				 A **case closed without seller resolution**[^3] means that the seller didn't resolve the buyer's issue, eBay stepped in to review the case, and the seller was found responsible.
			- ###### minimum requirement
				- You're allowed 2 cases closed without seller resolution within an evaluation period, or 0.3% of your transactions – whichever is higher.
			- ###### examples
				- [[IMG_8306 2.jpeg|Volume/Transaction Defect ,Example 1]]
				- [[IMG_8307.jpeg|Volume/Transaction Defect, Example 2]]
			
		- ##### transaction defect rate
			- ###### transaction defect means:
				- The seller cancels the order unexpectedly (e.g. because it was out of stock, or because they sold it to someone else)
				- The buyer reports an issue, but the seller doesn't resolve it, ([[#^df1f50|Case Closed Without Seller Resolution]]) as defined in the section above)
			- ###### minimum requirement
				- You're allowed up to 2% of transactions with defects within an evaluation period.
				- You'll only be evaluated as Below Standard if your transaction defects are associated with more than 4 different buyers.
			- ###### Examples
				- [[IMG_8308.jpeg|Transaction Defect/Unique Buyer, Example 1]]
				- [[IMG_8309.jpeg|Transaction Defect/Unique Buyer, Example 2]]

		- ##### late shipment Rate
			- ###### meaning 
				- Sellers are responsible for shippping items within their stated handling time using the delivery service selected by the buyer
			- ###### carrier
				- With an integrated carrier, LATE = 
					- The delivery scan is after the latest estimated delivery date <u>AND</u>
					- There is no carrier scan within your handling time
				- If no tracking information is available, LATE = 
					- Buyer leaves feedback
					- Buyer confirms the package arrived after the estimated delivery date
			- ###### minimum requirement
				- A high late shipment rate on its own won't cause your account to be evaluated as Below Standard, but a low rate is required for [Top Rated status](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/selling-policies/seller-standards-policy?id=4347#top-rated).

		- #### Calculated by
			- How much have you sold? 
			- How many poor buyer experiences?
			- Fulfilling orders on time?
			- Resolved any buyer issues promptly
			-
