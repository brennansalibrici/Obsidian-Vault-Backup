## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

Rating:: 8

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was a mostly good day and I feel like I got completely destroyed at the end
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- Leveled (for the most part) the bottom of the new retaining wall. Felt good to be outside working and Coleman came out to hangout with me. It was sweet of him and I was emotion:: thankful for him to be with me but I also feel emotion:: regret that I didn’t pay better attention to him or respond better to him. I need to get better at that. 
- Had [[EMDR]] with [[Dan Schmoyer]] today and it seemed more intense that usual. I saw this story of the boy in the cave. I ended up feeling pretty spaced out. Dan said I might be like that for the rest of the day but it was ok, we accomplished a lot there. 
- Took Hailey to get her contacts fitted. I was soo emotion:: proud of her! She tried so hard all night last night and all day today. She got one in on her very first try there today! 
- Had a very tough workout at the gym today. I felt emotion:: proud of completing it because I pushed myself and it was tough. Also connected with [[Lori Kinney ]] over it too because she did the same workout earlier in the day. 
- I felt emotion:: wanted by [[Lori Kinney]] for the first time in a long time today when we invited me to the DollarTree to shop for easter stuff for the kids. We had fun together just bumming through the store together. 
- I was going to show [[Lori Kinney]] what I did with the retaining wall and I quickly found out that I completely misunderstood what she wanted. I felt completely emotion:: crushed. It all seemed so aggressive and felt like she didn't want to hear me in any way and after the highs of feeling connected to her earlier, it was especially soul crushing. I discovered afterward that after an intense [[EMDR]] session, its expected that you'll be in a hyper aroused emotional state where you're especially prone to feeling emotion:: misunderstood, emotion:: rejection, and like your intentions don't matter. Its like a triple whammy - They say its like opening your emotional floodgates where:
	- You're feeling things where you didn't really feel them much before. 
	- You're feelings are turning hypersensitive where everything feels like a 100 on a scale of 1-10
	- Your core emotional being is like it has the skin pulled back as it were and you're not in any type of protective mode; you're vulnerable and wide-open to anything coming at you
