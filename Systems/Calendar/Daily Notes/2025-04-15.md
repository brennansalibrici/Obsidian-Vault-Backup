## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

Rating:: 7

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was busy but we got alot done around the house today

### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- I was super frustrated that trying to just get my expenses done today because I kept getting locked out by my browser. IT is way overreaching
- I started to get very angry with the amount of pushback I've been getting from trying to book travel. I did everything in the rules and *still* get yelled at. I called Patrick and talked to him about it and he made it very clear that enough was enough and he would handle it. I sent him screenshots 
- I felt rather satisfied with myself for the amount of cleanup that I got done in the garage. 
- Had [EMDR] with [[Dan Schmoyer]]. It was good to talk out a couple things with him but I felt like we only half-assed EMDR today
- I had a very heartfelt conversation with [[Lori Kinney]]. It was actually very painful to share where I'm at and to hold space for her pain as well, but I think I did a decent job of not getting defensive; I tried so hard to just stay with her. She shared with me how numb she is. I know that she's terrified of being vulnerable with anyone again. I know that more than anything she's seeking peace and safety. In spite of that, I think that I hear her saying that she really wants things to work out and be beautiful between us but she's too afraid to even want to hope for that. We talked for over an hour about it. I still feel a bit emotionally spent.
