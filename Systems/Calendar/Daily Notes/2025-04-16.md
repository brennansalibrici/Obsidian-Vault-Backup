Rating:: 9

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was a great day. We didn't end by completing what we set out to do but we had a great day, got alot done and Lori & I worked together very well today and I'm super thankful for that
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- Lori and I looked at rocks to build a retaining wall to mulch in the back yard. I felt a bit of urgency to get this project done because once we get the boat happening, I don't want to have to give up time on the water for projects around the house. 
- We worked really well together with the kids, at the store, making decisions and starting on the project. Its exciting, and makes me feel full of relief, hope, and exhilarated to see us work together like that and to see her engage with me as well hope
