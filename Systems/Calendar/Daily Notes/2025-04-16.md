## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

Rating:: 9

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was a great day. We didn't end by completing what we set out to do but we had a great day, got alot done and Lori & I worked together very well today and I'm super thankful for that
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- Lori and I looked at rocks to build a retaining wall to mulch in the back yard. I felt a bit of #feeling/urgency to get this project done because once we get the boat happening, I don't want to have to give up time on the water for projects around the house. 
- We worked really well together with the kids, at the store, making decisions and starting on the project. Its #feeling/exciting, and makes me feel full of #feeling/relief, #feeling/hope, and #feeling/exhilarated to see us work together like that and to see her engage with me as well #feeling/hope
