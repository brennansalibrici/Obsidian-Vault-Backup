## Notes
---
Utility feed is on 2 separate air switches near the intersection of Greenbrier and the street that leads to the guard shack. Theres no lockable LOTO point for positive control. The pole furthest to the east takes down the transformer feeding MSB3 and the pole further to the west takes down the guardhouse and the transformer feeding MSB1 & MSB2. There is only 1 transformer that feeds both MSB1 & MSB2.
