notes: "The site's generator was inoperable. We rented a 1500kW rollup gen from United Rentals. We de-termed the load side conductors of the site's generator and connected the output power from the rollup generator to it. This put backup power back through the ATS switch which also preserved phase syncing, phase loss etc. All 3 services have 4000A breakers and the lowest setting requires 800A to test for GFR. We werenâ€™t able to get this much power out of the Megger so we were forced to do a secondary injection test using a GTUTK20 handheld test unit. It took extra time during the days to track it down, had to drive up the north Jersey to go rent one and then had additional issues getting the software installed on my laptop."
