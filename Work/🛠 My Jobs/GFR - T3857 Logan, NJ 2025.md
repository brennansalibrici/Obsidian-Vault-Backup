# JOB ATTRIBUTES
deficiencies: ""
notes: "The site's generator was inoperable. We rented a 1500kW rollup gen from United Rentals. We de-termed the load side conductors of the site's generator and connected the output power from the rollup generator to it. This put backup power back through the ATS switch which also preserved phase syncing, phase loss etc"
