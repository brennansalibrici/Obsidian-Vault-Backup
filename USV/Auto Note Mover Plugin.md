Description: Move notes to a specific folder based on title or tag
---
## What
Go to the plugin's settings to set up which tags should be moved to which folders
## Uses
### Specifying type of input
When you add a subtag to [[My Inputs]] note like ` #input/video`, the note will automatically move to the new folder using (but this is only if you have a new file type for that subtag set up. A subtag like `#thought/musings` does not get moved into it's own note)

### Quick Archive

Use `#archive` to move a note to the archive folder
ex) [[An archived note]]
