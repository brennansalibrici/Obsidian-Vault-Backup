Workspaces can help save [[Obsidian Layout|layouts]] of your interface, to allow for quick switching between use cases

You can have workspaces for:
- Each project you're working on to save related notes and views
- Different use cases for your vault
	- ex) One for a certain project, for taking book notes, for doing a weekly review, etc

To view your workspaces, click the icon on the sidebar, or ![[Obsidian Hotkeys#^ec631a]]
