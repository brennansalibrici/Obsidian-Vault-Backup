You can view all of the important markdown in the [official Obsidian site](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax).

If you prefer having a menu to access the different syntax, you can look into the `cMenu` [[Obsidian Community Plugins]].

## My markdown philosophy
In my personal vault and published notes I also have a different color for bold and italics to make them further stand out.
### Bold
Important terms or points.
### Italics
For introspective questions or statements.
### Quotes
For words that are not mine.
### Headers
My main note organization method.

Use this to group your ideas within a note.

Most common ones I use include:
- Golden Circle
	- Why/Benefits
	- What
	- How/Application
	- Examples
	- References
### Bullets
I mostly use bullets when writing in my notes because...
- If you want to quickly select the current line you can just press `Cmd/Ctrl+a`
- You can fold them up and down quickly using `Cmd/Ctrl+up` and `Cmd/Ctrl+down`
### Callouts
Technically not default markdown, but I mostly use this for my published notes since it's more prominent and informative than pure text like this.

People tend to use it to put their queries or special views in them, but I don't like to do that in case you need to reuse the query. That's where I use [[#Headers]] instead.

I prefer functionality over visual pleasantries ðŸ˜…
