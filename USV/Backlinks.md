Notes that have outgoing links to the note you are currently on.

You can see this two ways:
- Pane in [[Obsidian Layout]]
- Can enable in settings to show under a note
	- I currently have it enabled but this can get laggy if you have hundreds of backlinks to a note, so once that time comes you can disable it
	- I do think it's useful to have it enabled now just so you reinforce the idea of links being one of the most important [[Organization methods in Obsidian]]
