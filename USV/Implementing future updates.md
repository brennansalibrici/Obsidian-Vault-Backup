This vault is a continuous project of mine to improve my own life, learning, and productivity.

As new practices and Obsidian features emerge, I will be updating the USV to continue improving it.

If you want in-progress updates and give suggestions, then you can [[Join the community]]!

Otherwise, I will just send you emails with new versions whenever they come out (as long as you are still subscribed to my newsletter) ðŸ˜Š 

Since Obsidian is hosted on your local computer, it's a bit more complicated to help you update the vault.

So you have two options:
- If you've just started and haven't changed the vault, you can still download the new version of the vault and move any notes you made yourself
- If you've already changed a lot of the vault, you can just implement the changes yourself, using a new vault as a reference

Information related to new updates and changes can be seen in the [[USV change-log and documentation]]. In here you can see:
- What I'm currently working on or am planning to work on
- Previous emails I have sent for new versions of the vault
- When certain features of the vault have been added in certain versions
