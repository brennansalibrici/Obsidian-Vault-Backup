Obsidian Bookmarks are an easy way to access the frequently visited notes in the vault like [[My Home]], [[My Projects]].

I personally just use quick switcher to access my notes though ðŸ˜…

But one benefit is being able to assign hotkeys for bookmarks.

If you want to add a bookmark, simply run the following command to do so:
```button
name Bookmarks: Bookmark... (Ctrl/Cmd+Y)
type command
action Bookmarks: Bookmark...
```

I've provided a basic structure for the most essential notes you may find yourself revisiting, but feel free to customize it for your own needs!
