## CSS Snippets
Custom stylings you can add to your notes.

If you go to `Settings -> Appearance` and scroll down to CSS snippets you can see which ones are in this vault like:
- [[Minimal Cards Styling]]
- If you want to have the content of a note take up the entire width of the page, you can add the value `wide-page` to the `cssclasses property`, as shown in [[Wide page example]]
## Hiding metadata
For notes with lots of metadata to keep track of stats like the daily and weekly note, it can be helpful to have fields automatically hidden, or just hide everything completely.

The plugin `Metadata Hider` is installed for you to have that opportunity. With it you can:
- Choose certain fields to hide in the table/sidebar pane
- Set the `hideMetadata` property to `true` to always hide the metadata of that note
