## What
The biggest benefit I see from canvas is the ability to create dashboards in 2D that surpass a linear note document's capabilities.

For example, [[My Habits]] can be shown horizontally like [[My Habits Board.canvas|♻️ My Habits Board]]

[[My Vision Board]] can be shuffled around in [[My Canvas Vision Board.canvas|My Canvas Vision Board]]

## How
I personally don't use canvas for thinking much so I would recommend visiting another resource in https://obsidian.md/canvas
