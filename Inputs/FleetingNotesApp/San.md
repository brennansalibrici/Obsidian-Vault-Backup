It’s so hard to begin to wake up ad realize what you e been missing and what u didn’t nurture and accept that the doors just closed to u now. I don’t know how to handle the grief. 

I desperately want to be seen, understood, acknowledged validated and accepted. 

I feel judged and it feels so final like there’s no chance of coming back or being actually understood. It feels like she’s decided ‘I know what r u.’
