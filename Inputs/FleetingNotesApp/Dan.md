I believe there are skills issues and capacity issues that need to get improvement before it would make sense to do marriage issues. The talking at/object treatment/self focused communication or whatever we call it is pushing me to the end of the plank and doesn’t allow for peace or conflict resolution and only results in me walking away from the conversation because it devolves into defensive personalization and my voice gets snuffed out. That is what I’m hoping to communicate with you to Dan that this is pushing me away and if that is not your goal then it would be in your best interest to grow/mature that 

Feels like she’s saying to me that she’s got me pegged as what she wants me to be. I can’t even explain myself because that’s being selfish. It feels like I have to just shut up while she unloads whatever crap she wants to on me. I have absolutely no voice in any of this. 

I don’t even think she actually wants me to change because if I did, then she’d have to face some of her stuff and it much more easy and comfortable to bark at me
