- Is there a list/library of similar exercises so if u can’t do one on your workout, can u sub another one in. Like if u had to do pushups because there were no dumbbells. 
- Track workouts (in the gym) on the app too? 
- Track stretching? 
- don’t know how I did it but I think the exercises in the workout changed locations. They moved to a different block. I tried to minize some of them but they went away
- wouldn’t let me log out with an incomplete field
