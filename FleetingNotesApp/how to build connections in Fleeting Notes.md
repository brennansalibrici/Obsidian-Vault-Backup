The title of the note is unique and is used is to link between ideas. To build connections:

1. Use the double square brackets, type `[[` to create links (if you have links, a link suggestion popup will appear)
2. clicking text (e.g. [[START HERE]]) will show a clickable popup which will open the note or create a note.
3. OR create a new note with the (+) button in the bottom right corner and add a title to the note. Then repeat step 1 to link the note.

Note: you can use arrow keys and enter/return to select a link from the link suggestions.
