- Isn’t that the truth - supposed to feel belonging and safety and love. I seem to consistently experience the exact opposite. If I were only concerned about myself I would’ve cut and run a long time ago to try and get what I want or what I’ve been searching for. My desire for connection and all the rest of it is real and valid but i choose to stay with Lori because I still care about her so deeply even after the soul crushing pain and hurt that she’s caused me. It makes me want to explode when she calls me selfish because I literally chose to give up everything I’m looking for and wanting for the off chance that she can get herself together and just maybe we might get to have it all but I not very convinced anymore but still, I don’t know what it is but I simply can not walk away from her. 
- I can Become a steady and solid person for her. How do I recognize that she’s not coming to meet me, and that means what there’s no interest? There’s no desire for me? That means this is not gonna work or this is not a real relationship because she’s not giving anything to me? She always wants to bring up how I never call and check on her before I’m away. Do I ever get to ask same question of her? What the hell did you ever call and check on me because you cared about me? And what does that say about how you feel about me? or what I mean to you? That’s all real and valid too.
