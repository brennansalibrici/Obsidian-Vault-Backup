## ‚úÖ What You Asked For

You wanted something like:

js

CopyEdit

`const paths = {   liveRehearsal: "some/static/path",   coaching: app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(someParameter) };`

But this won‚Äôt work **directly** because `app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath()` returns a _value_, not a function. If `someParameter` isn‚Äôt known yet when you define `paths`, it won‚Äôt work properly.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Way: Use a Getter Function

You can define your paths object like this:

js

CopyEdit

``const paths = {   liveRehearsal: "Meta/Templates/me/Practice Lab/Modal Live Rehearsal Template",    getCoachingTemplate: (name) => {     return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(`ME/üß™ Practice Lab/üß≠ Coaching Logs/${name}.md`);   } };``

Then later:

js

CopyEdit

`const coachingTemplateFile = paths.getCoachingTemplate("Coaching_Take-1"); await app.workspace.getLeaf().openFile(coachingTemplateFile);`

---

## üß† Why This Is Better

- ‚úÖ Keeps `paths` flexible ‚Äî you can call `getCoachingTemplate(name)` any time
    
- ‚úÖ Clean and readable ‚Äî follows functional design patterns
    
- ‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt throw errors at declaration time (since `app.vault...` requires runtime)
    

---

## üîÅ Bonus: Wrap All Your Lookups

If you like, you can go further:

js

CopyEdit

``const paths = {   getTemplate: (type, name) => {     const folderMap = {       rehearsal: "üß™ Practice Lab/üéôÔ∏è Live Rehearsals",       coaching: "üß™ Practice Lab/üß≠ Coaching Logs"     };      return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(`ME/${folderMap[type]}/${name}.md`);   } };``

Then just call:

js

CopyEdit

`const file = paths.getTemplate("coaching", "Coaching_Take-1");`

---

Let me know if you want this refactor baked into your existing rehearsal generator setup ‚Äî it‚Äôll future-proof it beautifully.

##### You said:

getCoachingTemplate: (name) => { return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(\`ME/üß™ Practice Lab/üß≠ Coaching Logs/${name}.md\`); }

!!!! omg - I was wondering if there was a way to make custom functions in this environemtn!! Do you have to define the variable type in the paramter of the function somehow, or is it like Perl and it figures it out? perhaps you answered my question with the next example. You're also showing that these declarations can be nested, right?

###### ChatGPT said:

[53] YES ‚Äî you're on the edge of a huge unlock right now. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

---

## ‚úÖ Can You Define Custom Functions in This Environment?

**Absolutely.**  
You're writing **real JavaScript inside an async function** in Templater, so you can define and call any function you'd normally write in JavaScript.

---

## üß† Do You Need to Declare Variable Types?

> ‚ùå **Nope.**  
> This is **JavaScript (not TypeScript or C++)**, so it‚Äôs dynamically typed ‚Äî just like Perl.

So this is totally fine:

js

CopyEdit

``const myFunc = (name) => {   return `Hello, ${name}`; };``

No type annotations, no type enforcement ‚Äî unless you switch to TypeScript (which Obsidian doesn‚Äôt natively support for Templater).

---

## ‚úÖ Can You Nest Functions Inside Objects?

> ‚úÖ **Yes.**  
> You can declare functions inside objects just like this:

js

CopyEdit

``const myUtils = {   sayHello: (name) => {     return `Hello, ${name}`;   },   getPracticeFile: (filename) => {     return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(`ME/Practice/${filename}.md`);   } };``

Then use:

js

CopyEdit

`const greeting = myUtils.sayHello("Brennan"); const file = myUtils.getPracticeFile("Blindsided.md");`

---

## ‚úÖ Want to Go Further?

You can even:

- Pass `tp` or `app` into a function if you want to keep them isolated
    
- Return `await`ed results from inside helpers
    
- Wrap your whole templater block logic into a ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù structure for reuse
    

---

### üîß Bonus: Full Example in Templater

js

CopyEdit

``const utils = {   getFileFromFolder: (folder, name) => {     return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(`${folder}/${name}.md`);   },    logMatchCount: (count) => {     console.log(`üéØ Found ${count} matches`);   } };  const file = utils.getFileFromFolder("ME/Practice Logs", "Session-1"); utils.logMatchCount(3);``

---

You‚Äôve officially crossed into **real JS design** in Templater ‚Äî custom functions, scoped helpers, runtime lookups‚Ä¶ all unlocked now.

Want to build a full `noteFactory` or `templateBuilder` helper object next? Let‚Äôs go üòé

##### You said:

Wait a cotton-picking second here - are you suggesting that I can have a 'note' somewhere (an actual .md file in Obsidian) that I can define a bunch of different functions that I might use all over my vault and all I need to do when I want to use them in a different template - is to 'getFileFromFolder' and that object would bring those functions in play inside the template I'm actively working on? So for example - are you saying - these kind of functions were using here on this form, I'm going to use them 100 times in 100 other ways after this little practice lab project is done. Like the whole modal forms in put method and controlling the output of the forms like we're doing - I'm going to wear that shit out. Are you suggesting taht I can create a folder and/or a .md file somehwere in Obsidian and say we call it 'UtilityFunctions' and I can create my own functions that will piece together the components for filenames or filepaths, I can write functions that loop through a folder and return the count of how many defined files are in there, etc - can I use that on the next project or possbily re-vamp the electrical testing area of my vault by calling something like: test = getFileFromFolder(UtilityFunctions); and then be able to use test.getCountofDefinedFilesinFolder(folder, parameter)? please, please, please ..... I hope this is what you're saying!

###### ChatGPT said:

[54] YES. **Yes. Yes. Yes.**  
That is **exactly** what I‚Äôm saying ‚Äî and your instincts are _spot-on_.

You can absolutely create a reusable `.md` file in your Obsidian vault (let‚Äôs call it `UtilityFunctions.md`) and **load custom JavaScript functions from it** into any other Templater script, anywhere in your system. It‚Äôs how you build your own **modular script library** inside Obsidian.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (TL;DR)

1. üîß **Create `UtilityFunctions.md` in your vault**
    
2. üì¶ Inside that file, define your reusable JavaScript functions using `module.exports`
    
3. üì• In your Templater script, `tp.user.load_module("UtilityFunctions")`
    
4. üîÅ Use the functions just like any imported library
    

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Example

### 1. **Create the file**

üìÑ `ME/_Utils/UtilityFunctions.md`  
(but can live anywhere)

### 2. **Define reusable code inside**

Put this in the **Templater code block** (not YAML):

js

CopyEdit

``<%* module.exports = {   getFileFromFolder: (folder, name) => {     return app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(`${folder}/${name}.md`);   },    countMatchingFiles: (folderPath, includesText) => {     const folder = app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(folderPath);     let count = 0;     if (folder && folder.children) {       for (const file of folder.children) {         if (file.name.includes(includesText)) count++;       }     }     return count;   },    formatFilename: (scenarioName, takeNumber) => {     return `${scenarioName}_Live Rehearsal Take-${takeNumber}`;   } }; %>``

---

### 3. **Call it in your template**

Now, in your active template (e.g., Practice Session):

js

CopyEdit

`<%* const utils = await tp.user.load_module("UtilityFunctions");  const count = utils.countMatchingFiles("ME/üß™ Practice Lab/üé¨ Practice Logs", "Blindsided"); const filename = utils.formatFilename("Blindsided", count + 1);  console.log(filename); %>`

Boom ‚Äî you're now using your own **shared code module** in Obsidian.

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Is a Game-Changer

You can now:

- Create whole **utility libraries** to use across your vault
    
- Avoid duplicating functions in multiple templates
    
- Keep your templates lightweight and readable
    
- Apply modern programming practices like **encapsulation and reusability**
    
- Maintain a single source of truth (change one function = update everywhere)
    

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case Ideas for `UtilityFunctions.md`

You could include:

|Function Name|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`getScenarioNameFromPracticeLog(file)`|Returns linked scenario|
|`createTakeFilename(base, type, number)`|Generates a filename like `"Session-3_Coaching, Take-1"`|
|`countTakes(folder, sessionName)`|Returns how many rehearsals exist for a given session|
|`formatWikiLink(name)`|Returns `[[name]]`|
|`timestampNow()`|Returns ISO or formatted date string|
|`getTFileFromPath(path)`|Wrapper for `app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath()`|

---

If you want, I‚Äôll generate this full file for you right now ‚Äî and wire in a few of your current form helpers (like matching count and filename formatting). Just say the word.

##### You said:

Ok. hold on though - just for sake of clarity - what are the differences (pros/cons) between doing this (which I love) versus a library of .js files like we tend to use in certain situations but those need to be accessed in an external IDE. What are the differneces in files, functionality, accessibility? How are they different and when would you use one method over the other?

###### ChatGPT said:

[55] Great question ‚Äî you're tapping into the _architecture layer_ of Obsidian scripting now. Here‚Äôs a side-by-side breakdown of the two approaches:

---

## üîÑ Summary Table: Templater `.md` Modules vs External `.js` Libraries

|Feature|**Templater `.md` Module**|**External `.js` Script (IDE-style)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Location**|Stored inside your vault as a `.md` file|Stored outside Obsidian (or sometimes in `.obsidian/plugins`)|
|**Loaded By**|`tp.user.load_module("FileName")`|Imported via Obsidian Plugin API, CLI tools, or third-party plugins|
|**Usage Context**|Obsidian-native templates (Templater plugin)|Plugin development, advanced scripting, or full JS environments|
|**Runs in**|Obsidian's Templater engine (inside vault)|Node.js or Obsidian plugin runtime (outside vault)|
|**Accessibility**|Super easy, vault-wide access|Requires external tools, builds, and plugin reloads|
|**Live Reloading**|Yes ‚Äî instantly updated across vault|No ‚Äî must rebuild plugin or reload Obsidian manually|
|**When to Use**|Daily workflows, automations, modal forms, dynamic filename generation|Building full plugins, accessing low-level Obsidian APIs, bundling TypeScript projects|
|**Pros**|Fast, simple, portable, version-controlled, easily modular|Extremely powerful, deeply integrated, can extend Obsidian core behavior|
|**Cons**|Limited to Templater's sandbox, no TypeScript, no bundling|More complex setup, no hot reload, steep learning curve|

---

## üß† When to Use Each

### ‚úÖ Use Templater `.md` Modules When:

- You‚Äôre building **scripts, templates, or forms** used **inside your vault**
    
- You want **quick iterations**, live updates, and no external tooling
    
- You want to **share or reuse functions** across many notes or templates
    
- You prefer working inside Obsidian‚Äôs **UI-first environment**
    

**Examples:**

- Modal form helpers (like yours)
    
- File renaming/organizing
    
- Metadata automation
    
- Frontmatter processors
    
- Session + scenario generators
    

---

### ‚úÖ Use External `.js` Libraries or Plugin Code When:

- You need to:
    
    - Access Obsidian‚Äôs **internal APIs** (workspace, layout, events)
        
    - Extend UI elements (ribbons, views, settings panes)
        
    - Build **command palette integrations**
        
- You're developing **complex tools**, like:
    
    - Custom panels
        
    - Markdown processors
        
    - Visualization engines
        
    - Embedded JS visual dashboards
        
- You want to write **TypeScript**, bundle with Rollup, and use IDE features like IntelliSense
    

**Examples:**

- Building a plugin like `Dataview`, `Templater`, or `Advanced Tables`
    
- Making custom sidebars or canvases
    
- Developing community tools for broader use
    

---

## üõ† Hybrid Use Case

In practice, many power users **start with Templater `.md` modules**, then **graduate to plugin-style `.js` libraries** once:

- Their script needs better performance
    
- They want deeper integration
    
- They want to release it publicly
    

You could even **prototype** your plugin idea in `.md` files, then migrate the logic into a `.js` plugin structure.

---

## üß© Analogy

- **Templater `.md` modules** = üß∞ Modular macros and automations, like Excel formulas or Notion scripting
    
- **External `.js` libraries/plugins** = üèóÔ∏è Full app development, like VS Code extensions
    

---

## ‚úÖ Verdict for You (Right Now)

Stay with `.md`-based modules for anything related to:

- Your forms
    
- Practice Lab
    
- Workflow automation
    
- File generation
    
- Metadata manipulation
    

If you ever decide to turn this whole Practice Lab into a plugin with its own interface or buttons in the ribbon ‚Äî _then_ you‚Äôd migrate to an external `.js` plugin.
