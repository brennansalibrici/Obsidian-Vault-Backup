## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

Rating:: 8

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was an exhausting day; travel days usually are, but it was a good day. 

### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
It was good to get the Scope of Work situation figured out with Patrick. I felt relieved about that but I feel a bit of anxiety after talking to him about the other stuff going on in the shop. I'm going to be really glad when the scrutiny is over.
