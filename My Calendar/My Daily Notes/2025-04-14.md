## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

Rating:: 8

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was busy, maybe a bit chaotic but good. We got alot done today
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- Kids to SoundHouse. It was nice to bond with them a little driving around. 
- Crossed stuff off the list. It felt good to get some things accomplished and I was glad to be able to help Lori as well
- Got the car keyfab situation finally settled. I feel relieved to finally have that off my back. Don't have to deal with them again, we got what we needed and we're good to go now. 
- Learned more about the boat. This felt exciting to learn some new things and to have something so fun that I've always wanted and its amazing to have something like this that I can share with Lori.
