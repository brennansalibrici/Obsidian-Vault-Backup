## Today
## Reflection

### Rating

```meta-bind
INPUT[progressBar(minValue(1), maxValue(10)):Rating]
```

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was a hard day. I feel emotion:: exhausted because of relational drama between me and Lori for most of the day
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- DMV. We got there late (which wouldn’t have mattered because the lady that does titles never came in until 10am!) In trying to schedule an appointment to get passports I touched on my work schedule which set Lori off about how I’m such a lone wolf and makes her want to detach from me because I haven’t shared my work calendar with her yet (in the way that she wants me to)
- EMDR with [[Dan Schmoyer]]  It was actually another rather intense session. I was pretty emotion:: shocked to find out (as we were talking through stuff) that it seems that I have lost my initial emotion:: confusion and feeling emotion:: blindsided when something goes sideways with [[Lori Kinney]]  Instead I have noticed that I feel emotion:: curious and more emotion:: empathy and truly want to understand where she’s coming from so I can try and fix it. I find myself leaning towards her which is unusual for 2 reasons- 1) That has not been the way I have usually reacted to those situations and 2) I never really understood what ‘leaning in’ meant and as I’m describing how I feel to [[Dan Schmoyer]] I couldn’t find any better words to use to describe it!
- Got home and started working on the retaining wall again. I felt very emotion:: giving and this whole idea was just that I wanted to do something really nice for [[Lori Kinney]]  I know she’s wanted this for a while. The same exact situation occurred as what happened on [[2025-04-17#Story]] Almost word for word. I tried so hard to not get emotion:: upset and hear her perspective and mirror her emotions (I really don’t know how well I did or not) but it was so emotion:: devastating to set off her trigger *again* (I never meant to ignore her or make her feel like that) and to become aware that no matter what was going on or being said, the fact that ai was simply not going to be heard or valued was emotion:: soul_crushing to me. This whole thing was about doing something kind to make her feel cared about and valued and instead it turned into a disaster again making her feel the exact opposite and me feeling destroyed again too. At least this time I was able to better recognize the effects of EMDR and give myself a little room for grace even if she didn’t.
