Summary: |-
  Flew to CT today. Traveled with Rodney with a layover in DTW. Preparing for shutdowns this week.

  John has a really good video about how he does his weekly review here: https://youtu.be/VqlzlnLLD0g?si=yvjHu4FgOYLYgRVn
Story: I am prone to a bad attitude about the 'crackdown' on travel and job costs. Its very draining. I'm excited though about being able to use ChatGPT as a help to better manage my emotions, practice empathy and to get prepared for EMDR.
