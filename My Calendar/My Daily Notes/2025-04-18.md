Lori
##### **What's a potential obstacle/stressful situation for today and how would my best self deal with it?**
I'm still very raw after EMDR and my feelings are hyper sensitive and raw. I need to be aware of that in the sense that I try to take everything with a grain of salt and give myself some grace while I'm coming back down

Lori

### Summary
##### Overview and your general feeling of the day. What kind of day was it?
It was a good day. Resolved and kinda made things right with [[Lori Kinney]] 
### Story
##### 'Highlight reel' of significant events throughout the day - emotional, insightful or significant. Why did it matter? (Separate events with bullet points)
- Had a really good talk with [[Lori Kinney]] again about last night and about us in general. It seems like she’s telling me she’s not completely closed off but is super guarded and scared but doesn’t want to stay that way. It makes me feel emotion:: encouraged. Something that’s super important to her is to have a man that will selflessly give instead of the type of guy who just takes and takes and gives nothing in return. She’s literally telling me that she’s not so guarded or closed off that she’s not considering or imagining what it would be like to try again. And she’s literally telling me how to get her. For the first time in a very long time I actually have emotion:: hope!
