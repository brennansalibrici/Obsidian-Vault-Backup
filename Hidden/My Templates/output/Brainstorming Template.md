## Brainstorming

### Topic

%%What is the big idea you're thinking about? Why are you writing this? %%

### References
%%Are there any existing notes, resources, or experiences that come to mind related to the topic? For each thing, why is it related and how can it be helpful? %%

### Brain Dump
%%
Write out any other thoughts that come to mind, then create a cognitive scaffolding that combines your references and brain dump.
Break it down into branches and sub-ideas for further elaboration %%

## Organized Ideas
%%
A place to start your rough (or maybe even final) draft.
What writing framework or checklist best works to guide you towards your ideal finished product?
%%

## Potential Outputs

%% What can I use these ideas for? Content, new notes, etc. %%
