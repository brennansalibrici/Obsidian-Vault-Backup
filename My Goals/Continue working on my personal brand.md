## Notes

## Planning
### Objective
**What is the definition of DONE?**
`INPUT[textArea(placeholder(Description)):Description]`

**How is this project personally significant to me?**
`INPUT[textArea(placeholder(Why)):Why]`

**Envisioning success, what would it FEEL like to have completed this?**
I would feel liberated as I have complete autonomy over my work schedule. I get to choose which projects to take on, and I have a more direct influence on people's lives instead of being a cog in a machine.

I would feel driven to serve my audience and help them solve their problems on a daily basis by solving my own and sharing the solutions.
